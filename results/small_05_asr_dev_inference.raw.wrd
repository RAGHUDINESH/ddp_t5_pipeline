madam president a ~ first ] of all i % wuld ] like to thank all the members o av participate in this import on debate
i look forward to continue to work with you on theirefor sharing proposal and bringin it to a successful conclution with your support
we all agree in the last session in ` strasbur ] that development is important but we need to remember it now when we are talking about the financial contributions
we need to invest intre neghbours of development and ye most of all we need to invest in good governance
he are ready to give! thousand ] of % eu ] to trafficers because there is not good governance
many migrants are not even extremely por but they are all extremely desperate
if we get back for example to the issue of migration we will see that this is the ) k ] question the question of governance
overty war but also the lack of freedom and bad governance is what makes desperate people to undertake dangerous journeyes in tresearch for a better life in * europe ] and development cooperation is part is an important part of the answer to this challenge
in all this efforts ahead of the ~ third ] international conference in % adizabeba ] we need to be aware of the fact that ) financi ] along will not be sufficient policies are of fundamental importance in achieving sustainable development goals we need policies that will ensure that financial resources are used effectively and in areas that will bring to further mobilisation of resources unsustainable development
furthermore we need a completely new approach to financing development
t s the ~ first ] regulative act which will provide police in all member states with their common rules
i suppose and i am sure that it is not the end of discussion is not te beginning of discussion because it is really a very complicated package and i do not think that all of hour members are radthe full package
we have to be ready for that
it does not mean that we have to be technologially ahead of technology we have to be very firmon our principle ground it is the fundamental rights of people to bepeople } peole peole ] ~ first ] at technology for people
y not technology is a head of us
was! one ] of the regions that brought us to the financial crisis
could not we do more and could you perhaps be more specific what has been done so far and what are you aims
mr president i also want to raise the issue of respect of religious freedom for all without discrimination because this is a basi
efs also concributes to the & cop twenty one ] objectives to keeph sustainable development and environment objectives in mind efse also increases the local presidence level through the reinforcing of the ) european ] investment advizory help
we all know that some member states will do their best to weaken this legislation
we took many measures to improve the situation and i believe we reached certain improvement
with climate change bringing more extreme wether event we need to be able to protect human lifes and valuable essets and make our regions our cities and our touns more resilient
as for energy @ three years ago ]e % eu ] ` hedo ] government decided to set the current year @ two thousand and and fourteen ] as a clear dedline for the completion of internal energy market
well ordes o track the commission action plans have been published and updated
` parliament ] aso says clearly that it urges the member states which are absent not to impose any obligation on encription providers that would result in the weakening or composing of the security of their networks or devices such as the creat creation of facilitation of backdors
for the % eu ] the immediate challenge is to help ensure a fair and inclusive electoral process and be prepared for a range of senarios
but we should not lose sihte of the bigg picture
the ) irish ] system works within a legal and regulatory policy directive framework dictated by the % eu ]
% ireland ] is no worse or no better than any other place but i object to hostile comments about % ireland ] eminating from % london ] % new york ] and the ) german ] media
all these places have experienced regulatry and banking challenges and problems equal to and in many cases far worse than what we have faced in % ireland ]
the constant sniping from some of our % eu ] neighbours has been based on pregidous } brotheran ] objective fact and thous little for % eu ] solidarity at a time when * europe ] is going through enormous financial and economic challenges
tha you very much for the question
raising funds for research and care addressing discrimination at work and advocating for policy change with decision makers all depend on previous awareness and understanding of multipls caroces
our choice @ tomorrow ] is to go for a strong mandate with a bund and go for negotiations or go for negotiations using as a starting point or mandate and end up with something meaningless
in exchange we go the protection of the vulnorable marrincosystems
still @ one month ] after we ` av ] voited our compromise the ` council ] did not put it on the agenda did not even present it i used this time to talk with the member states and the presidencies
if this compromises further what i down it will become meaningless
if you want to change the rules in ` parliament ] of the balance of the countries you have change it ~ first ] in the ` council ] and then we will see finally i } wuld ] say i fully understand the position of the ` council ] in the speets an caundidart issue but they also have to understand ours because we have to approve
the candi rate we have to approve its programm and we have to approve the colleage
finally you have been in the * ust last week ] i hope you had interesting meetings
would you have abates to give us @ today ] on the shopping and ditrast case
in this report we strongly support the independence of the commission and national competition authorities
ti time wath with the ommissioner a munia in
as you know this is a non binding report but it sends a strong political message to the commission
` wso thirdeen ] this may be the last competition report of this term @ next year ] we have ) european ] elections again
yet the importance of our partnership with the ` eib ] and with the % european union ] in meeting our commitments both to our shaholders and to our countries of operations is clearer than ever
~ second ] under the agus of the % european union ] ew structures of cooperation between ` ebid ] and ` eib ] offer great new opportunities for us to work together
these initiatives facilitated by ` ec ] funds bring us together to work conpretely on specific projects and programmes combining the strength of each institution and as such offerin eccellent crucibl in which to fordge the development of our joint work
wet wide range of stakeholders we are working together to implement the plan and are developing the coordination and coorperation mechanisms to do so and we see as we saw @ last august ] when faced with the conflict driven banking crisis in % jorga ]
~ third ] i take the ` european parliament ]'s views as welcome input to the early stages of the ` ebad forth ] capital resources review which we will conclude at our annual meeting in ` zsagrop ] and made
faced with the dramatic decline in private flows of credit we came together @ last month ] with the ` world bank group ] to launch the joint irfie action plan and support of banking systems and lending to the real economy in * central ] and * eastern europe ]
an increase of more than
~ first ] the context of the financial and economic crisis renders any encouragement of greater cooperation between ` ebird ] and ` eib ] more relevant than ever
t at the same time we have to acknowledge that our risk exposure is also increasing
% wtousand ] and! ten ] the ` ebid ] has taken a pro active stands ind response to the crisis supporting our cliantes ind countries of operations we are expanding our instruments and aim to invest! seven billion ] in @ two thousand and nine ]
yetthe crisis also means that cooperation between public international financial institutions is no longer just a policy driven asperation but a vital necessity
the ful implications of the current situation on our purtfor you on the development of our business cannot yet be clearly seen
i believe it is in this context that we may find devisions of labour applications of joint expertise and the necessary mechanisms of cooperation including common standards which you have called for
this kind of ) ohi ] cooperation born of need is the kind that works best
i refir in particular to the % western bulkan ]'s investment framework now being launched as well as to the eastern partnership announced by the ` european council ] in recent days which will build on the goo cooperation we have } alredy ] established through our memarandum of understanding and the neighbourhood investment facility
the action plan recognises that an effective crisis response in * europe ]'s integrated financial markets requires fast and coordinated action by all stakeholders parrent banks which own a large part of the region's financial sectors
mr president what worries me most is the suggestion that the ` european investment bank ] has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis that it can somehow act as the ` urop ] wide body to provide stimulas where member states have singularly failed to coordinate their own stimula
i thought the world had seen enough of clever financial tricks
the ` eib ] has a liverage of about! thirty five ] times and its ) sharheold ] as a member state governments
& wl ] e a serious issue if it wer to go bust like some of our commercial banks the report ` evn ] encourages the ` eib ] and the commission to increase lending by experimenting with new innovative financial instruments
the danger is that if it expands its activities too far into subwat supporting commercial banks and governments as has been suggested then its enviable high creditrating may be dingrated like some of our governments
however i would stress that the commission has neither the capacity nor a desire to lead toth & telivery ] of the action plan itself
the implementation of the action plan will require real cooperation commitment and leadership from member states and regional stakeholders to deliver the ihtso projects included at this stage
this rapid progress is important if we are to maintain a momentum as we enter the implementation face of the strategy
this is the only way to ensure that thei ownership of a strategy is in the hands of the member states and other stakeholders
the commission very much expects ` parliament ] to be actively involved in evants such as the annual forum
the ~ first ] formal assessment of progress made will be presented under the ) polish ] presidency in the @ second half of ]
this will give all stakeholders and opportunity to consider how the @ first months ] of a strategy have gone and what lessons might be drawn aready at that stage
that coordination monitoring and reporting is done by the commission and the implementation on the ground is led by the member states ore organisations of the % boulticcy ] region
i would now like to say a fewwords about the pland governance system which is proposed for operational implementation of the strategy
this is! one ] % irea ] where here has been much discussion among the member states but the overal approach is that polity orientations will be taken by the ` council ]
the bulticy strategy has required a comlet completely new approach for ` euopean commission ] ` aisi ] is the ~ first ] time that we hae prepared an integrated strategy for a group of member states who have to face the same challenges and who may benefit from the same opportunities
in financial terms although there is no additional financin from the % eu ] budget the strategy proposes a more coordinated use of existing funds and the more imaginative approach to other funding sources such as the ` european investment bank ] or ` enodi ] investment bank
of course it is not a complete surprise to mea that ` parliament ] is taking such an interest in the strategy
t dleven however priory to that the ~ first ] annual form of the bulticy strategy will take place @ next year ]
i would like to conclude by saying that i look forward to continuing to work closely with the ` euopean parliament ] on all aspects of a strategy
the ) swetish ] presidency has led positive and constructive discussions in the ` council ] which are to lead to conclusions already in @ october ]
here we expect to see a wave of cordination meetings to ` kikstartt ] various priority areas and individual projects included in the action plan
responsibility must rest with the relevant member states and other stakeholders directly involved on the ground
your backing is crucial to maintain widespread visibility for astrategy to maintain highl level political support for strategy and to maintain pressure on the member states and t regional actors to deliver results
in addition the commission proposes to play the role of a facilitator in the case of difficulties
i would like to underline this point as it must be clear that all our preparatory work on the strategic framework that i have just described will account for not! unles ] we start to deliver genuine visible concrete results on the ground hence the importance of a strategious action plan which has also been drawn up during the preparatory werk
the population of * europe ]
the majority are set up with & mas migration ] they do not want any more migrants and they want to send back those who are now here
we are on! one ] side and on the otherside there is the whole corrupt political ald the thing is the majority of the citizens of * europe ] cannot really speak up because they are punished they are oppressed the ae a tis heat speach laws that silence people is really strange that we ar the * nes ]
we do have freedom of speech and we speak up for the majority of their citizens of * europe ] but they shouldso speak up and they should support hungery in our efforts
mr president could i say that the commissioner showed a good understanding of the construction industry
i would emphasise the need for more & c ] marking absolutely essential we do not want to see any more national standards and i wish this hole process every success for the future
all i would say is that i it is a larger pertage of the overall gdp something like! twelve thirteen ] and materials say! four ] or! five ] so it is a very important sector i am a civil enginer by background and it was a privilege to do the opinion on behalf of the ` n ]
a very important measure in a very important industry
the construction industry does need a regulation after @ twenty years ] of having the directive in place
it is evident that gender equality must be mainstrimed in all policy responses to the crisis in all education and training policies in the european social fund and in other programmes so as to enable greater social integration through employment
i have in mind a ` council ] with a wider mandate covering all economic social environmental and human development in the world
now we should do the same in the % european union ]
i think that we should pay a lot of attention to development issues also in that report
for me personally the most important achievements in this report are the recommendations on the substantial strengthening of the economic social environmental and development dimentions of the ` un ] system
by developing it into a ` sustainable development council ]
my report includes several proposals for strengthening the role of the united neation system in global governance and for improving the possibilities of the % european union ] and its member states to better achieve our forein policy gols inside the system
these ideas got a lot of support in ther negotiations but not enough in order to be accepted
i proposed that the ` council ] would have permanent members the % european union ] % us ] a gapan and the ) brik ] countries and rotating ones
according to the reporl this must be done in the ~ first ] instance by means of structural and functional reform of the ` economic and social council ] but we also call on the % eu ] institutions and member states to consider the possibility of strengthening their role in the ` ecosoc ]
} thangelr anzalamerca ] proposed in a speech to the ` world economic council ] in % dobose ] in @ two thousand and nine ] the creation of a ` u n economic council ] according to the model of the ` und security council ]
in the negotiations on my % eu ] % u ] and report i failt that those who emphasise the importance of security dimends an of the ` united nations ] were reluctant to strengthen the other parts of the ` un ] system
we do appreciate the own resources although we would have wanted to have more ambitious own resources
we have made an agreement in the framework of the & nited nation ] and it is called & sdigs ] anin your introduction m commissione and either you or } yunker ] mentioned the stiges and i think it is so extremely important that we use this budjects to make sure that all the mone that we spend in all these sectors are used to come up with good results on the sustainable development gows
all acense of scase is no longer thus ar judicial or political one
it is now a matter of human comperition
he should be immediately aan conditionally released on humanitarian rount
to protect the smes and to minimise blocracy and redtape the regulation offers an exemption for the smallest importance based on a threshold system designed to cover at least! ninety five ] of all impults to the % european union ]
all invustry initiatives have to fully comply with the international oicd duw diligiens guidelines elaborated to help companies respect human rights and avoid contributing to conflict financing
the vicious curcle has now been broken
stability in * africa ] and in all other conflict areas mis means less migration flows to the % european union ]
educating the stakeholders and achieving long term sustainable effects is only possible by an approach based on shared responsibility
o we just have to implement this regulation
we believe that legal trade is good and that trade is ment to sustain jobs and dat prossparity for people and or communities
there is! one ] thing that i believe we can do immediately distinguished colleagues and @ tomorrow ] we can show the determination of the ` european parliament ] to ensure clean and sustainable minilal supply chain
we have hammered out an effective and & welcobele ] regulation no let us show everybody that we are determined to make this ~ first ] step
received almost! one million ] of refugees frome neighbouring countries
to allow international investigation on the killings of protestors on government's concert land rabs
and to provide unrestricted access for human rights organisations and ingos to all parts of the country
our resolution list several names journalist online activists who are cept in detention
in a pailet already in
i explain it i this way of acting
@ next year ] we go to the citizens
sowe want to hear clearly what the commission is willing
weare talk in this house about performance based budgeting
! two ] twsanty one!! twenty two ]! twenty three ] where can i explain to my voters that * europe ] delivers that * europe ] have a better regulation that * europesa ] open ear delivers where companies and schooles and
so this is the question & reg committe ] want to bring forward and i hope that you can come over with at least a clear message because it was so silent it was too silent
~ second ] depending of this outcome of any of surch anticipated performance review is the commission willing to release the performance reserves earlier
we have our elections and we mat our negotiations in @ the year two thousand and thirteen ] in! two thousad ] an forteen we started
@ t two thousand and seventy two thousand and eighty eighteen ] there we stand and now we have to waight till @ two thousand and nineteen ] to have a eveluation n > this morning ] that is } aleady ] in the emvilope of the member states can be committed to be spent later in
we have to speak
in this context i support the idea of drawing letting * america ] and * africa ] more deeply into the existing transatlantic dialogue olleagues it is sometimes said that the % eu ] faces the choice between tigtening our strategic partnership with the % us ] or working toward more flexible coalitions with other players such as % south africa ] or % brazil ]
but it is a fals choice
ti time that the ` european council ] do its part of the job
we first had % ireland ] a veteran @ forty five years ] in the % european union ] but now we have creation the newest accession
many of us here re convinced that euro the % european union ] has been in a protrected crisis dragging its feet and hounted by nationalism populism and eurroforms and you know what
it is about the lack of vision to face with he ) european ] fassion the % eurozon ] needs globalisation and most notably refuge crisis
% alit ] is completely different
} toand ] ad @ fourty two thousand and twenty ] will the experience of @ two thousand and fourteen ] @ two thousand and sixteen ] be repeated
this renewed policy definitively leads to more local and ) european ] ethe value
and clarify the effects of the late start for the @ next years ] ` empristre ] will lead to a performancepayments in the years ` unil ]
the ex ante conditionalitys roed formulated lead to more integrated policy and a betterstructed and targeted results
ie } somethingyu ] in this house
we need a new payment plan n
we se commitments in the social field especially for younger people to bring ` emto ] a job
wo tousand and! twenty three ] i ask you to include ree aspects in this cohesion master plan taking away the ahinderences in the expenditure of te n the member states
member states were still working to finalise their programmes and cam with a very late agreed programmes for the new period
the practical reflection and the relation with he ) european ] semester is established cohesion concerns with ` treefort ] of the country specific recommendations and we make a performance framework that s an example as a said for this
this house will agree on a retemution
the resolution is the clear request without dout you could heari @ todayalso ] that you want to have a master plan onarcelaration and this is not a teoratical thing
this means that you l look and tell us honestly what does it mean if you start @ three years later ]
mr president it is just to say that i thought my name would be onon the signatures on hi
tdeen the ` council ] protects and supports the budget for instruments that sper growth and thereby create jobs namely such instruments as efs cosm rasmosplas and other
concerning subheading! oneb ] economic social an territorial cohesion which is another cor policy of the % european union ] for the creationgof growth and jobs the ` council ] proposes limited reductions of payment appropriations on new programmes of! one hundred and ninete ] an! nine ] milion ]
% othosand ] and! sixteen ] the ` council ] has accepted in ful all appropriations destined to the programmes and agencies dealing with the crisis including the use of the flexibility instrument for an amount of foune hurly thand ( thrte million ] and the contingency marging for an amount of
frankly the ` council ] and the member states are very concerned to note that not all institutions will achieve that go therefore the ` council ] has made it very clear in a statement thant it expects that all efforts are deploied to avoid any additional delays in implementing this jointly agreed reduction target
this means that we wish to finance adequately investments to sper growth and jobs for example through theuropean fund for strategic investments and to provide sufficient funding to tackle the stil ongoing migration crisis and related external policies
so you can see that the ` council ] stands fully behind the ` european ] genda on migration as was agreed between % usin ] to
% otothousand ] and! sixteen ] programmes and instruments that are related to the migration crisis and the facility for refugees in % turkey ] were not affected by reductions
the bedlogue should be fully absorbed by @ the end of this year ] in accordance with the payment plan
global * europe ] the ` council ] undertook a } thoro annalsis ] in order to identify space for creating the necessary margin since the commission's proposal for! two ] thouad ] and! seventeen ] has completely exousted the marging for commitments
i would like to begin by stating clearly that the main trust of the ` council ]'s position is the priratisation of expenditure
in conclusion as ` yo ] can see in an effort to find the right balance between on the one hand a sustainable budget in termes of budgetary constrains that rain throughout the * europe ] and on the other hand financing e essential political priorities the ` council ] has identified areas where savings are reasonable and necessary
in those areas that cannot be qualified a stop political priorities in the current circumstances reductions in the proposal of the commissioner aplied in a careful fasion in order not to harm programmes therform well and are coming up to speed
supatding ona however has also contributed to the general saving saving effort concerning some budgetlines where the ` council ] considers following a detailed technical annalicies that the commission has over estimated the real needs
i tink th discussion show that we may have some different views but in general we are united by the fact that we want to have a workable budget a good budget for ) european ] citizens
for! two ] ) thousad ] and! seventeen ] and we want to keep the main focus of these discussions on! two ] ) thousadand!! seventeen ] budget
* europe ] can surviving global economy only as a competitive economy
if i magers very briefly to some of the important points which were made during the discussion
looking forward to our cooperation
i tink! one ] of the issues challenges we have is that we have! two ] many priorities and to little money and the question is how we use the money in % th ] in the best possible way
all the people have to feel our assistance
we have to stop all supplies of military acquipments to the undemocratic governments in the region
of course we have to be very careful not to support the forces and movements with islamised ideology
we have to have a united ) european ] position
on @ ten september two thousand and nine ] @ last week ] the commission adopted a communication on steping up international climate finance which aims at speding up the international negotiations
in this respect it is worth mentioning the global partnership on technology which aims ar doubling investment in & lo calban ] technologies
with! two hundred fifty pages ] of negotiating taxt on the table the negotiations have not yet gathered sufficient momentum to come to an agreement that is ambitious and detailed enough
however among most partes there is a sense of fegecy and the willingness to focus on areas of convergence
money willmake or breake the deal we need to mobilise private investment and promote the establishment of arobust international carbon market but substantial public funding will also be required
furthermore we have to strengthen support the porest and most vulnerable countries to adapt to the increasing adverse effects of climate change
there is a donting task ahead of us with the intense negotiations over @ thecoming months ] but failure is not anoption
we need comparable and more ambitious emission reduction targets for the group of developed countries which in agrecate today offer less than! fifteen ] reduction as compared
it is not only that it is also the other cars thath have been cheating and the differences in e different member states like some of them are mandatory the others are voluntary some are only on the national carman car market and others are different
will you do that
we also have to look to the future andyes we have to care about our car industry but a new ` ara ] is coming it will be electrified it will be sharing mobility and if we do not make sure that we do that for our industry t we do not make sure that we have! zero ] emission mandate then the cars will be important from % china ] and otherwere in the world and our car industry will have a big problems aso these! millions ] of people
! three million ] cars have not been recalled yet
how shell the commission make sure that all consumers and * europe ] have the same rights
actually restrict the access to the % eu ] market for them it could be a consequence of such a extensive regulations
t sessive regulation could really harm the economies of the developing world and could actually caus jobs there
@ ten weeks ago ] stabilisation and association agreement entered into force
! one ] political development is that reducing corruption and organised crime and making judicialy more efficient has been assessed as good by the commission
a lot has already been said about the magnitude of this rights violations and about the relevance of the topic trafficking in human beings needs to be addressed with the human rights based and victim centred approach
victims and vulnerable populations need to be put at the centre of all efforts
the prevention of trafficking in human beings and the protection of its victims must be our priority gol
access to trust thes support measures shelter and education need to be ensured independent of the victims willingness to cooperate incriminal proceedings
the principle of non criminalisation in this regard is also vital and needs to be implemented in all member states
further demand needs to be tackled as it can be considered a root cause
accountability needs to be ensured for both offenders as well as nowing uses
for the new strategy i think that financial investigations and action against money lundering need to play a bigger part in fighting trafficking in human beings and to ensure that confiscated essets are used to support and compensate victims of trafficking
does the commission agree on this and how does it intend to address this in the new strategy
i am woried about the treand of trafficking in human beings being mixed up with other legally distinct contects such as migrant smugling increasingly addressing trafficking nd human beings througha security lens for instance in the context of recent migration policies
how will the commission counter this trent in its new strategy
i also call for greater internal external coherence in the fight against trafficking in human beings and to further enhance an deepen cooperation and coordination among all relevant actions
that would give the enlargement of more prominent present supplementing the usual progress reports for the countries
therefore i sincerely welcome the commission's strategy and the action plan as documents which will officially and permanentely put a } vestembalton ] enlargement back on the ) european ] agenda
it became also clear that we simply cannot wate for all major political issues to be settled before we endever further elargement
all this could provide a strong political back jrop for the difficult work that ovates on allsides in order to welcome the front runnel countriess % serbia ] and % montenigo ] as full members in
additionally i would call the commission to draw up anual reports concerning the implementation of this strategy and the action plan which would be discussed here in the plenary
it is important not just for the countries of the region but also for the % european union ] itself because without providing a credible perspective for full membership for all the countries of the * western bolcoms ] the % eu ] global role will not be credible ecause this is our region this is our ~ first ] commitment
we need to invest more both politically and financially yes it is a difficult process because enlarsement is a common effort
but at the same time there is always an alternative we should not forget and the alternative is embreacing nationalism and populism and creating rivalries and hostilities again
when there is a will there is always a way and @ last year ] the % republic of macedonia ] made # tramendus ] progress back towards progress andte ) european ] perspective
the public violence the ) haite ] speech against ` edibita ] people in & egopt ] is rampently increasing and we have report on that
to say that we are passing on the message m commissioner is just not enough you do not pass the message about human rights you demand human rights to be respected
we ae different kind of partnerships
but @ today ] i wanted to raise the specific situation of ) elgibiti ] persons being persecuted
it is also a question when the authorities do this kind of violence
we are ready for more concrete cooperation in this fill and the partnercry priorities are given as te opportunity to eplor new forms of common engagement
these were the ~ first ] association council with ` eagipt ] in @ seven years ] so the ~ first ] is the beginnin of the revults in the % awor ]
the ` crgroup ] recognises the practical value of regional development funding and supports efforts to ensure it spent more efficiently this! sixt ] report clearly calls for more to be done there it is not a clean bill of health
an i and others in the group are not holly convinced that there is as full an understanding as there should be that this funding is not a revenue substitute nor is it intended to be for more than @ a third of the century ] asas been the case
furthermore i do not believe that part of the agenda behind the in other respects unobjectionable % eurban ] policy is desirable * ether ] especially and i quote to improve the democratic legitimacy of the ) european ] project
best practice and cooperation yes
i welcome those elements
r } carmen ] the ` countro ] free or check free travel within the front years of the * chengan ] area is a basic principle on! one ] of the greatest achievements in the % european union ] although recent tragic events indeed put % sengen ]
their trevel documents are checked on the official checkpoints while non all other ) european ] citizens have to undergo such monitoring
while we must do our best in order to provide security for everyone undercurrent circumstances such discrimination and unjustified violation of the & shengen agreement ] is both unacceptable and unreasonable
this is exactly the aim of the # european year of citizens two thousand and thirteen ] to mark the! twentythnivestary ] of the establishment of the % union ] citizenship by the & treaty of mastrict ] and to give a newmomentum to he debate on union citizenship
as members of the ) european ] parliaments the only directly elected % eu ] institution we have a crucial low to play in promoting the aims of the ) european ] ear of citizens @ two thousand and thirteen ] by bidging the gab between brassels and member states communicating rights and benefits of % heu ] citinzenship andorsing citizens concerns in formulating % eu ] policies and promoting participative democracy
to enjoy protection by the diplomatic or conconar authorities of any member state in a thelth country
all % eu ] citizens must be informed and enjoy without discrimination all rights granted to them by % union ] law and the & charter of fundamental rights r ]
in view of the focomming ) european ] elections we mus raise awareness on the legislative powers of the ` european parliament ] and encourage citizens to vote so that the are voices heard clear by ` un ] decision makers
to address the institutions of the % union ] to enjoy free movement of goods and services consumer protection public health equal opportunities equal treatment access to employment and to social protection to enjoy the new right of the ) european ] citizents initiative granted by the & lispon treaty ] to strengthen participative democracy through access to documents information good governance and administration
at times of economic political and social crisis only @ twenty months ] before the next ) european ] elections puting union citizenship and participative democracy at the centre of the political agenda is absolutely essential
to } peticion ] n the ` european parliament ]
we need to support ` eazo ] in order that people arriving can have the recylum application properly proceed
the ~ second ] point i we have to change the norman cleture of the amed budgetlines % bease ] putting integration in return together on! one ] budgetline just avoinding being clear on what the mone is being spentd
but of course we have some questions on detals it is matters of tremendous political importance that we need to debate
i ask wonder whyeuroport should receive the same increase in funding and staf as ` eazo ]
o you had a very energy efficient airplain and thenit could fly on & soller ]
development was lifted on an equal footing with deplomacy and defence
we have to fight against poverty and promote ecologically economically and socially sustainable development all over the world
in development policy we have to act in close cooperation with the % united states ] since in this field our basic value gols and interests are very close to each other
this is how we can most effectively tackle also the root causes of our recent security and migration challenges
steying a firm note to fgem for me also means that we have o protective laws and we have to provide strong support to the gross routs organisations that work on this
it is a simple treatyprint that i think everywomen should be in proud posession of because knowing your body and is also a way to take back control to take back power
@ today ] we see the attacks on women's bodies from thee liks of } trumps ] with this awful gagro that wants o to } threataein ] women's sexual and reproductive health and rights world wide
we say no to all forms of paterarical control over our bodies and we say gest to sexual freedom and choice for women and for proper sextuality education where we can learn about our rights and our women's rights and our bodies and about % citeries ]
it has nothing to do with religion but it has all to do with } pat turkey ]
these struggles are linked
many people do not even know what it looks like and the dictionaries in @ two thousand and seventeen ] still get it % rong ]
it is also simtematic for me that th cliteries almost everywhere has been systematially neglected and araised
te notf gem support ` grassralt ] organisations
as collegues have said the proxmately! one ] % hunred ] and! thirty ] woe hundred and fourty million ] women and girls have % beente ] victims of efgm ef g is older than ) christianity ] or % islam ]
i e used by many fgm activists that fight against fgem but it gives us the power to protect it
colleagues commission our message must be clear
but saying no tofgem also demands that we say no to all forms of hatarcal control of our bodies
@ in the past years ] all our attention was focused towards the lowering of * seor two ] emissions and particale matter without devoting enough attention to nocs
with the new proposal we are introducing new real driving emission steps that are closes to the real word use and we will also introduce new type approval legislation that will help these * arcaust ] to become much cleaner but we do not need new agencies for that
we should use this period to prepare new development plans focusing on new innovative technologies in order to safegards * europe ]'s position of being the number one carmaker in the world
} wteneed ] stronger rules that will effectively deal with the omission problems for thesal caus
for @ the upcoming years ] the clasical technologies based on fossil views and the alternative solutions will be present side by ` sid ]
but at the same time there are some disappointing informations
} sthe repporter ] has stated we tackled very important topics like fegnews ) wicalblowers ` geublocking ] and licences always defending freedom of expression which is the crucial and ecentral point of our concern
and now we have a decision that for the ~ first ] time in this ` parliament ] is rejected by all the political groups by all committies with the huge majority almost unanimity
i almost fel sorry for the commission
madam president it is heard to believe that we are sitting here @ today ] discussing miner changes to the rules e value adde
no doubt the gestures towards % european union ] will continue but democratically elected governments have a primary interest in looking after the populations that elected them
never mind that prodent government finances are essential to the survival of the euro there is nothing else that these countries can do about their budgets
probably an even more serious concern is the huge exposure of several * europe ] * eurozone ] countries to the defalting debts of * eastern europe ]
i therefore ask the commission to urge the implementation of local primary health strategy to empress healthy listile awareness campaines and the early introduction of screening programmes across * europe ] so that we can meet our gols of healthy aging by to @ thousand and twenty ]
% bein ] in mind the guidelines for & colleracte acansca ] screening from @ two thousand and en last week ] i hosted a conference witha launch wide paper setting the standards for the prevention diagnosis treatment and care of & colleract acns ] across * europe ]
if we take so long with % tha ] rle of low country like singer por imagin how long we will take with bigger more problamatic countries
with cyber criminals getting better at breking into protected networks i strongly believe that the only real way to win the battle is to have people with similar knowledge and expertise fighting against them
r } presidnt ] even though i thought i got your message that i should not ask for the flor i do it anyway
` ido ] think that it is actually a fundamental right to have a basic banking account
governments feel the scepticism of public opinion and try to transfer responsibility to the commission
so the % u ] is hipocritical situation where the ` council ] does not approve gm & oles ] but some member states cultivate them
usually our group is propenent of community approach but in this particular case we should not have onesised its own policy
the inclusion of complementary environmental reasons as well as list of social economic grounds for the restriction or prohibition of the ngos by member states will make this report more legally soli
ma president any operator that is responsible for damage to the environment must be held aaccountable for their actions
however the determination of the accountability should be down to the member of state
you mention the establishment of a secondary liability regime based upon the systems already adopted by several members of state
this is tipical of the % eu ] implementing more and more andnecessary legislation
the report calls for the consideration of a ) european ] fund for the remadiin of environmental damage
so if you propose this fund who is going to pay for it
the implementation of the ` council ] decision of @ twenty six april two thousand and four ] would greatly encourage % turkey ] to implement the & e turkey association agreement ]
as meps i hope that we can send a strong message on behalf of those citizens that we are in favour of a free internet where the privacy of users and their rights are respected fully we must today stand behind the block of citizens amendments that have been tabled as the best way of defending those rights of our citizens
these amendments if pased will restore some sort of balance between % enguser ]'s rights and freedoms and the rights and freedoms of others including the right to intellectual property protection and indeed the right to privacy
the aim of this proposal should be to protect those who need protection but also to strengthen the rights of citizens to access information within the law when and where they see fit
service providers should be made act in a transparent m manner at all times and if in very acceptional cases restrictions to access are required they should be fully accountable in justifying these restrictions
national powers should have a role in investigating any restriction that servec providers imposed
for the moment the cultural clenzing undertaken by disht other pressious sights they have seased has not taken place at $ palmera one ] of the greatest of all cultural treasures of the * middle east ]
indeed the destruction of such siece is in fact contry to ) islamic ] scollership where previous civilisations and the learning and arcitecture of antiquity was studied preserved often in corperated and in a positive sense used
as my colleague } borrise jonso ] ond the mare of % london ] has put it this is not a clash of civilisations
as a former ` unesco world heritege ] site charmen myself the thought that this wonderous } jul ] could be destroyied concerns me and so many others deeply never forgetting the probably over! a thousand ] people whave lost their lives in and around the sight
& twanty two ] additionally the seperate votes on t amendments! twenty ] sx! thirty six ]! forty ] si seventy one ] and
to they all concern the same issue that we re now lost so i propose that we v vote all of this in the block
member states because in the digital single market more and more personal data of people from! one ] country member state will be collected stord and used in other member states
they would have some effect but i think we need to take attention of the lok hols
they collabrate supporting each other
so in this regard we realy would like to see n a future much more brow active and cooperative role fromte commission side as ardvise it will be very very difficult for us to cooperate
however madm commissioner there was a key measure missing from your proposal
a % unik ] sense of ownership of seand its resources and a realform of regonalisation will be established i want to call uppon all members of this ` parliament ] to give this measure sometef and vote for amendment! two ] hunded and! fifty three ] this is the main novil idea that ` parliament ]
it will allow us to restore & fic ] and increase the income of ) ficiermen ] throughout the % european union ] by increasing both the quantity and the size of % iscot ]
would like to welcome the constitutional reform % albania ] has been successfully going through which is a very very very difficult task we all understand that but we also know that when it comes to judicial reform its the implementation which the most difficult and most important task if % albania ] engages in this reform process according to its emvisage reform strategy we ill be very satisfied with that
ith that is a ver reasonable question and yet of course we cannot only use the market
i think we should also use other instruments like regulation for instance
we have just adopted & energy efficiency directive ] that will definitely also put us in the right direction
because this is a huge massive problem that needs a fundamental change in the way we consume and produce energy
e touse what we have now and that is the gs system
% eealy ] know how buisy we are
@ four ozerd days ] and nights nearly @ eleven years ]
ia recent participant in the twitter site and i have to say that i am more than surprised and impressed about how much information is on that sie from the % european union ]gives a huge amount of information andi would like to congratulate them for that
i am sure that this quest for freedom is universal and that the % eu ] has a moreal obligation and a strategic interest to avoid more stragedies in the * mediterranean ] by promoting peace security and the rule of law in a more firm and ascertive way in the countries of origin
e was thankful for reaching the free world she became really happy only when her homeland was finally freed from opression and eventully we came back to % croatia ]
we know that there is a shortige of skilled labour in this % syria ] and at the same time there are lot of people who will lose er jobs and will need retraining
we hope that we will go all together
the des must improve the framework for digital service providers to stimulate growd but it must also make the fight against illegal countents more successful and it must improve the tansparency and oversight
either we develop ai based on our own values and with the economic benefits or we ent up using ai developt on other countinentes without those values and without a large part of the economic benefits
e strong risk based approach offers the best way forward here these challenges are difficult but i fully sreport the effect the efforts of all the rapporturs here @ today ] and we are not even close to satisfy legal situation but these reports ore an excellent start
some people boren in a different time like myself might want to go back to how it was before because it seems like a simple time
the future will be more digital not less and it brings incredible progress that we as policy makers should embrase
so brings dangerous that we cannotignore any more
let us be honest with each other colleagues the % eu ] has done more to regulate the online world than any other countinence
over the past decaites we have not followed up illegal countent and illegal activities online wehve the same riger as illegal activities of line
we have not achieved any meanful transparency over how allegoritms push content to users on a messive scale
we have not grasped the impact of it on our democracies our culture and our fundamental rights
instead we have focused on voluntary cooperation which is good but not good enough
not nearly good enough
we cannot leave this over to the private sector without oversight and enforcement we must keep this in the public debate as a priority and we must regulate no matter how technicale these files are
the difficult challenge before us is to find the balance between digital progress and respect of fundamental rights
the value of law making is the real chaer change its effects
if we start of with conflicting regulations and directives that undermine each other instead of complementing each other we have losstd the battle before it starts
we must respect the scope of each digital fi
~ secondly ] the fundamentans of the & ecommerce directive ] were great but its greatest issue was transparency
we must improve an enforce minful transparency and i call for a clear mandate from this ` parliament ]
~ thirdly ] we all agree on the importance of notice and action mechanisms to remove illegal countent on line but this places the burden almost entirely on users we therefore should complement notice and action with clear and appropriate obligations to remove illegal countent and its public authorities should provide a funding to follow up on this
finally i would like of course personally to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all my colleagues on the ` libdz ] report for their excellent cooperation
they established some priorities
to our children and young people we have to parsoner titals ond theoratical topics but above all practical values
indeed education and culture have to do with civilisation
golden visses make an negative impact on the stadus of % eu ] residence and citizenship
let me out line brefly what the commission is already doing to improve its isplementation
we are warried by the dterorating situation when it comes to respect for human rights persecution of political opponancs as well as } jornalist ] is becoming a rule in this country fole of contrast a country which is on the one hand incrediblly reach in % oilandiramonds ] and on the other hand has! one ] of the hight raights of child mortality in the world
he is the corrupted aleds who are depriving the people of ` ungol ] of thei basic human rights access to helpth care food the education by still ing public money intended for basic social services we are seriously concerned about the possible mismanagement of ` eew ] development funds by the local authorities and in this regards we are requesting form the commission to review dhe national indicative programme under the! elevent ] edf and to ensure that good governances respect for human rights onth fight against corruption are the main financing priorities for this fabulaussly rich country but whosounsly ] corrupted alid
president after e decads of conflict & teurn ] in stability and % gola ] continues to face major challenges ` oee governanc ]
however it should be a decision taken by the % eu ] as a whole and of course coordinated with the % us ] % turkey ] and the % arablk ]
it is important that fae book is not only doing ats as they say is their business moderl but also deliver for trust in a way of delivering solutions and actions in the way of how they do their business model
ut i would also agreea it is very important to understand that there is a missing brik in this # wol ] and that the & eprivacy regulation ]
we need to get more rules ind place especially also for consumer control to get connectivity across the platforms in order to have a choice
business model of just urning money by endevering the data of individuals has to change because that is not only the business mode
we still need to fixe that problem because the communication data needs to be protected in a specific way
so we can be very proud as the % european union ] and especially of ` parliament ] that we have a tool to protect the privacy and integrity of our citizen's life with the ` ggpr ] in place
it is about fundamental rights privacy awareness but privacy enforcement as well namely the right to be forgotten and shrined by the ` gdpr ]
but it i also about democracy because f news is a highbrid ware of intoxication mannipulation lies an hat speech aimd to weaken democracy through interfering in elections and enhancing populism and the eurofobia so it takes a response ) european ] which means that no member state can do it on its on before a giant in the internatelike face book but also legal binding and effective law but it takes action that means that doing nothing is not a choice
that is what the ) european ] citizens areexpecting from all of us and that is precisely and exactly what we ask from you
the ` europeanan commission ] must take initiative action and now
upholding these values is of crucial importance for the proper functioning of the % european union ] because they guarantee & tat ] member states fulfil their international low obligations and that they can trust each other and the institutions of the % european union ]
the % european union ] was founded on the principles of respect for human dignity freedom democracy equality the rule of law and respect for human rights
failing to so many have severl coms % euences ] including the possibility of the % european union ] to all part almost @ sixty years ] ] pi ] since its foundation
ri before our & ise ]
this report also has other important implications for the fundamental rights of minorities ) roma ] children women and ) elgbta ] people and for those seaking ) assylum ]
this was proved in @ the last copl of years ] this must be rectified that is why in this report we call for a new mechanism that is automatically triggeled in case of breaches of fundamental values and rights to remidy the breaches to avoid the matlalisation of systematic trades in member states our common ) european ] fundamental values are being trated ~ first ] and formost from within
tonerow focus we mean that we will be missing some targets
! two ] many mandates at % tha ] the same time can lead to fragmentation and too high cost
so we should keep finding the right balance and fighding the trade ofs to be focused and efficient inthework and ` eib ]
through vaniaus programmes and exchange of best practices and know how and by ensuring the availability of necessary funding for education training arquardness raising and empironment of women as well as for the continuous fight againstgender migalents stedar types and discrimination
it is about jobs and it is about money
so i understand that we are involved in a big legal battle wit noreway and i believe that we can find enough good lawers to win this battle
it is about ) european ] citizens thrust into ` european commission ] and institutions
ust let me give you few examples
} mapigi ] on oer members i have listened carefully to the debate @ today ] and i am in courrage by
we need to speak about gendar equality we need to counteract raisism & cenofobia ] and i sum of fobia
i was in the rival's horse waiting took out through customs when we heard and felt the ~ first ] explosion
no rifls or surveilance technology in the world can do that
then the ~ second ] explosion and some of us thought that the # rof ] was coming down upon us
my body remembers that fer and it is in that feeling that i refuse those that say that we have to learn to live with this terrorism is manmate and we can undo it
it is the moment to step back for he moment to just pause and sing through the implications of our actions untill now
are we taking the right measures to invest massively into better equipment and better cooperation of our police and security services and into effective deereadicalisation or are we still puting forward expensive but ineffective and simbolic measures of mass data collection or intclrusive survelance measures against completely inocnd citizens
thereby weakening effective security and our freedoms together which we defend
therefore i am very happy thate commissioner } king ] is starting to investigate in the effectiveness of the! hundreds ] of security measures which % european union ] and its member state has adopted @ throughout the years ]
if this is what you are calling for then will come back in * europe ]
however the most offensive position that you have taken is the proposal that % spain ] will have the right to veto any ` brexet ] deal over the issue of @ jubralta ]
i do however have a solution to prevent % u ] prolto ] being used as uppoarn in # prexat ] negotiations and indeed end ) spanish ] claims want thum for all make % gabralta ] a fully integrated part of the % uk ]
i have been calling this for many many years and with the unk opportunities that ` brexis ] has given us i believe it is an idea whose time has come
give upralta real influence and the voice in ) west ] minister and send a clear message that ) jabrolta ] is not for saile
give he and our other ) oveceese teditories ] their own member of ` parliament ]
in this area we the % uk ] can learn from our continental cusons because the ) french ] give representation to their overcease territories and i propose that we should o
this i guaranteee would cause amends damage to the economies of the % european union ] and would result in putting many of your citizens out of work i what we call in the % uk ] cutting off your nose to spite your face
i want to make it clear in this chamber @ today ] the people of % jabralta ] are proudly ) british ] in @ two thousand and two ninety nine ] of % jupraltarians ] voted in a referendam against } shard sovereinty ] with % spain ] and the wishes of the people should be upheld
~ first ] our position our atitude committed fro ) europeans ] is very well described in & harmlet ] when } orasa ] describes the expression of the father of ` harmlet ] a countinence more ing sorrow than i anger that will be our atitude in our negotiation
i will just underline! four ] ideas that seem to me of the utmost importance on the subject
however it is a step that should not be taken lightly
to me as an nvy mep the effects of climate change to the rights of ngenerous people are ve very close to my hart because warming climate is the direct or indirect cause for many of the violations against their rights
we need to understand and be aware of that
budget consolidation needs to be complemented by e social investment strategy that will address the social employment and education tarkets of the % eu ] twent and! twenty ] strategy
not only have i had no answer but his ` ofpice ] refused to respond to my emals
gender divesity on bons leads to more sustainable decisions and therefore a more resistant ) european ] economy
i would therefore like to stress again the importance of reaching ~ first ] reading agreement on an issue which is so important to the % european union ] citizens
% stonia ] has chosen! four ] main objectives for the @ next six month ]
the logical order of these fore objectives seems clear the inclousive and sustainable * europe ] that % stonia ] wants to promote as the forth objective will be closer if the ~ first ]! three ] objectives are achieve
these! three ]gols may certainly facilitate a more inclusive and sustainable * europe ]
i am confident and convinced that in @ the months to come ] } stonian ] will go in the direction of denouncing any } breagh ] of fundamental rights in the % european union ]
question he validity have reach to do so because so far we have not yet restricted! one ] single substance using the reach system
that was my question if it really appropriate and f it we wer
let me say that such a policy chieft would be a strategic blunder the % eu ] should continue to do what it is doing only o it better
therefore i would say that recent events in % russia ] and the presidential elections actually present a case for staying the course in terms of our policy
% iranss ] some of its citizens as threats repression happens to real people people with family and friends
t question is basically what is the commission doing to prevent execution of these inosent people ) tho ] only dreamocracy and freedom
since they arein options are limited an the cash floris limited and the foreign currencies are limited they might very well offer as e quip proco naval basis or air basis to ) russian ] or ) chines ] military in the * midle east ] this is of course all bad news very bad news for anyone living in % isreal ] in % lebenan ] an ) yeman ] but also in the % european union ]
as a coordinata for the ` gcipo ] which we fully support and also as a diplomatic success from the % european union ] i would ask you in @ the next eleven days ] in beyond to do your utmost best
i admit most feriables or dependent on womakes the decisions in @ the beginning of next year ] in washingten but right now in the @ next coupple of months ] we have an expiring weapons embago and there is no movement from the % us ] to be expected which create a daunting challenge e must say to try to restrain and limit ornsailes to % iran ] and here lies a task for * europe ] ad i was very pleased to learn that a while ago that ) european ] efforts to restrain te limit or at least to delay on sales to % iran ] within the &p five one ] framework
the & al ternative ] means to find ) tha ] solution is welcome because baging will sell its arms
we r } stillon ] the & samepae ]
our talks with * europe ] with baging in % moscow ] on going canyou assure me that we are doing everything that we can to restrain
the ) iranean ] form minister has welcomed it and @ eleven days from now ] like the ) islamic revolutionary } gard co ] has said a new facse in military cooperation between % eran ] and the world will command
debates however seems to be concentrating on who ever gets the ticket in the wide house
still hope to limit armsels
i is no way then a pacal solution out of this long ongoing conflict international peace needs to be an international end over
it is therefore absolutely unacceptable that the countries has ) turky ] for example countributes with mercinaries among other things to % worsin ] the situation even more %eu ] is a region built on the idea that dialogue is the only way forward for long lasting peace it is our duty at the same time to take leadership for those ideas in our neighbouring countries
i am glad that the international community is ready to assist and u needs to support the ungoing process in s
that is what we ve have to improve an i really appreciate that you are taking this on your agenda and i would rally see that member states are supporting you in making better use of these systems
so yes in the beginning of this hw transition we will still need fossil fews and therefore % eu ] policies should support carbon caption enable government support schemes for ` blouw hiderigin ] and i expect the commission to move forward in this direction in its energy summer package
our biggest problem is that the perfects is becoming the enemy of the good
t in frastructure in the scalap of electoralises but also in carbon capture mutalisation and storage because we need to be realistic
all together that is not a sustainable posture
% lukally ] there is! one ] technology we all agree on that has the potential to decarbonise at least on heavy industries in transport hiderigin
we have @ thirty years ] to reshiate our antier energy system and we can do it and we will fail if we demand to be perfict but we wll definitely succeed by doing it as good as we can
just look at the political debates no nw clear energy please no carbon capture ther antils fossal fuls no biomas no gass in the transissue no wint meals in my back yard and no soler pennals on agricultural grounds please
how can we possibly be serious in reaching our climate gos without technologies like # garbant cepture ] biomas on % newklean ]
it might not be a solfor bulet but we all agree this energy ` carrea ] has ennormous potential and our ame is clear to create a new cleen produce green highbregin markets and a long term certainty for all parties involved and that requires massive investments
if we want to pay thei way for clean ` hiberagin ] we initialy } wil ] leed to invest in transitional technologies and these might not be perfect but they are good
welcoming criminals into our % european union ] with open arms just because those criminals } ara rich ] is totally outrages and means for feeting hat trust because regardless of what he ciperiet malts ) bulgarian ] or any other governments thinks the access
% eu ] country pasport also means the access to the whole % eu ] with all the benefits that takes @ years ] for normal people to enjoy even though they might have been exemplarheabitentes
this is not having a sincere cooperation nor is it upholding the integrity of what an % eu ] citizenship should mean convicted aligargs and corrupt businessman have nothing to do here in the % eu ]
the ~ second ] is also why does it include all the countries who have this kind of system in place refering to the infringement process of curse
in this respect we welcome all efforts to maintain command safety standants to put in place & vigorus ] protection measures strict controls and training in safety procedures as well as for enforcing regular risk assessment and preventing measures by employers
we should not be hiporcritical clinking formally to the letter of the treaty and taking it as i as an excuse to look aside from the real situation
hindering delivery of tangible benefits for our citizens andposing problems for those wishing to live work or do business across borders it as time to put people at the hat of % eu ] policy making by dentifying problematic areas dismantling citizens barrieers and improving implementation an ways which result in concrete benefits in the daily lives of our citizens
o harm in competition they are creating unfirve increasing innequality
maybe most of them are actul legal but they meter not only because in views of many people they are emol they meatr because they are harming our society
we can not only lead by example but more decisively used soft and hard powers to perso the others that are making the game unfair
in some cases do not be affraid to go for harmonisation
this is the moment where i have to turn to finance ministers because they have ther power
muc to be worried about persecution of opposition and journalists and therefore i think the % eu ] has to stand up ~ first ] up theforte ) european ] values and condition enhanced cooperation on convincing progress in the field of human rights
that is evident from the recently leaked cables with! one ] participant stating it is impressive to see how some member states present themselves outwardly as proponents of tax reforms and at the same time to } wach ] in the $ cote of conductwop ] how they actually behavein % eu ] discussions protected by confidentiality
i actually listen to my constituents and i know they ar furious about tax dodging both businesses and individuals
s i sayd there is no no room for complacency and manythings have to be done
ahead of the meeting as we know ) sumeu ] leader's voice concerns about external destabalising influences on the region and these have been mentioned again > tonight ]
i believe % iur ] response has to be evermore visible and strong engagement in the region to support those forces that fight for human rights and the rule of law
the % eu ] is a peace project a project that aims to end frequent and blody warres between neighbours horible experiences that the ) western bulkans ] know only too well
the prospect of ) european ] integration from % montenegro ] and the * western bulkans ] is therefore essential for peace in the region and across * europe ]
as the commissioner noted % montinegrow ] continues to demonstrate a strong commitment to % eu ] integration
its steady progress and opening chapters is not only bringing out closely to % eu ] accession but as many others have said is also providing a positive example for other countries in the region
my group tabled a number of amendment to the report specifically focused on enhancing human rights
i am pleased that many of these are reflected in the report covering topics from ensuring media freedom to improving working conditions for civil society to better arrangements for victims of genderbase violence to eliminating obstacles to health care education housing and employment for ) romean ] people
i am refering to that because we are at the cross rold
i think the fast track the commission and ` parliament ] is now attributing is an achievement because it is bottom up
e ~ second ] issue which is important andsan achievement for ` parliament ] is we are reflecting that we are living in a ever changing innovation environment it newts fast its ambitious i dreven by ` vec ] capital and it is competitive
but we held
tackle children's cancer
t for the ~ first ] time do not fight the fight between the %u two ] reduction and competivenesses that we just focus on energy production what we are going to do is yes it is not a contradiction to t teu two reduction and to be competitive but we have to do something about that and that is the focus on manufactouring we want to have! two ] free steeal plans
i ia leading but we have to do something about that leadership and we want to do want to have a } qanton contte ] in @ ten years from now ]
it is not forstunday speeches it is not for the sake of the ecodemic life it is about the substance of the welbeing of that continent
the reason why the welbeing of that continent relates starting in the @ eighteen century ] on its ability to innovate
this is the compenent which is open to the world
we do not want to have the * america ] ~ first ] % lik ] the % united states ]
e fast enough in the international context
the historic legacy of enligtement is very much related to that
wi eeve but we want to ask the world to work together with us
} ame changer ] that we have mor of a botom up approach
we want to have more of an ambition but we want to aline } seuto ] reduction and competition
i think what is important to understand is that this is not yet another programme that is one of the biggest contribution to the ) european ] economy but alsoto the well being of the ) us ] ) european ] citizens
i think what we are going to achieve with that programme is so we are going back we tackling the big challenges which related to the ordinary life of citizens we
in terms of technology we want to have a quantom computer
h research if you ar innowada if you ar smart if you inovative you go to the commissionan you could say in the framework of what had been decided in the programme do we get funded
we owd to the labour of our working population in * europe ] but the basis of our well being is innovation
by the % deeparak ] on a * south corean iland ]
we also expect % china ] to clearly condem this act
there have been severe casualties among the ) southcurin ] militaryand especially under the ) sevilian ] population of that % iland ]
we welcome that } barines ashon ] the high representative is actinin a concerned manner with other international actors our alies ind our strategic partner the % republic of gorea ] in condeming this clear violation of the & un ] & amists agreement ]
we call apon the ` dpketo ] avide any further esculation and to undertake all necessary efforts to maintain peace and stability on the ` krn peninsila ]
such prevention supposes major commitment as well as sustained and consetav efforts by the commission by national governmentes of countries expirences such fanominon by the civil societiy international agencies and other stakeholders
ste of tipes against women preventing them to fully enjoy equal treatment and employment and edugational opportunities in many countries
this is harising but under reported problem in several countries
what i am talking about
but even worse than those billions is frustration an anger when a toorist an artist and we love them weprovetoday a company proprietor or workr a student patient or adoctor cannot find those necessary information aform to fil out whente ` heoci ] encounters problems when delivering documents online this portal will help solving those problems and i find it especially important @ today ] when some politicians call * europe ] and immaginary community
we would all like to see jobs back in * europe ]
we have just had a very good discussion on youth on employment earlier to this discussion and i really think at we have an obligation to look into all possibilities of supporting growth and job creation
in this pespective one might be minor but important thing could be imploy financial participation efp
efp can strengthen small and medium sise enterprises offering mechanisms for innovative financing as workers may wis to invest in shares in their own companiye by which they are employed
despite these possiv possible benefits the focus on ep varies from member state to member state
this is the reason for me to participate in this very important debate @ today ] because when it comes to ` eimploy ] e share ownership and imploy financial participation the commission and ` parliament ] as wel mentioned by my colleague from ` epp arlon ] has been talking alot
we have done stardies and we have collected information data and knowledge
now i think it is time to act
i would like to ask the commissioner a very simple question
are you planing to put forward a proposal for an action plan on this issue
we have adopted an opinion on imploy financial participation we have made several studies we have adopted a resolution we have completed a pilat project and so on
i am sure that this was a mistake and i hope you will fixe that
% impolland ] e keching up * aregion ] initiative has helped for example to improve the condition for starting the business the management of financial instruments or special planning practices
i understand very well that some of you may seink that we are demanding to much but on the other hand we all know that challenges in the quality of governance hinders the @ perfour months ] of public investments
i very much welcome the main finding of these reports
instead of reinstating border checks and undermining! one ] of the % eu ]'s fundamental freedoms we need closer coordination among our security and law enforcement agencies instead of gatering vagrater amounts of data and undermine civil libilities we need more effective intelligent shaling to connect the dots from the information we aready collect
this is the way in which this ) polish ] authority this ) polish ] government this ) polish ] majority acts
sofne et was totally right when she explained that it is aprodictic its absolute
we are all ) rong ]
we have no idea what is happening there
we get it all * rong ] and they are all right
the problem in % poland ] is that they are trying to change the state and to model it so that generations to come will have no chance to change it back for the better
that is the thing that we have to be concerned about because there aret! millions and millions ] of pols probably! half ] of them more than! half ] of them tat would still make up a prity big member state who want a future in * europe ]

at that time we were focused pon the whole business of the modernisation of competition policy the significant amount of work taken forward by former commissioner } marriomonti ] and by the current commissioner nearly cruse and looking at the impact of that in terms of the commission's ability to deal with the abuse of market power to deal more effectively with mergers and state ade
we have seen record activity on the part of the commission in terms of dealing with hard cocartels we have seen the development of the ) lenian ce ] system we have seen record finds put in to operation by the commission and we have seen record activity in terms of mergers and state aide notifications as well
but i mention the change of context because of course we all recognise that since the reports were published by the commission the commission's work in terms of state aid particularly has really taken on a rather different dimension
& tht ] is being under taken and it is very important and our reports says so that in addressing those matters we recognise some of the challenges that there are for an effective open market
o e the banking sector in the % united kingdom ] at the moment is one very very clear area where there will have to be when economic circumstances become a little } carmar ] a general review of the new & arkitecture ] that we have got ond whether that & arkitecture ] really is compatable with the operation of a free fair and open market
mr president the ` europen commission ] produces its annual competition report and it is traditional for the ` european parliament ] to cast its iy over the report and to produce a nown initiative reaction to it
that is something similarly that our committee and ` parliament ] has been supported of
in this case because of timing factors the reports for @ two thousand and six ] and! two ] ) thous ] and! seven ] have been brought together but taking up! one ] of the points mentioned bye commissioner } barro ] alittle bit earlier it is the case that the context of our consideration of these reports has changed rather marketly since in fact we began the exercise of considering the reports some time ago
our committeehas drawn attention to! twoo ] specific concerns what we regard as being the unequal relationship between producers and retailers particularly in relation to food retailin
it is very important that when the commission gives its approval it is giving that approval in ways which are compatable with the treaty and do not create such significant market power in future that that & b ] becomes a senario for abuse in its own right
almost on a dayly basis the commissionis now looking at the effect of the baylach that are taking place in the context of the great financial termoile
by ` anlarge ] that has been a very good story in these reports and that is very clear from the reaction that we have from ` parliament ]'s own report
this is a process that is gathering pace in terms of modernisation because the commission is currently bringing forward proposals in a wite paper on introducing private damages
to me as an nvy mep the effects of climate change to the rights of ngenerous people are ve very close to my hart because warming climate is the direct or indirect cause for many of the violations against their rights
we need to understand and be aware of that
ncentive during negotiations has to ly in the implementation of the commitments taken by % japan ] to eliminate nontarlive barriers in various sectors particularly in the aultimotive sector
% w ] is not the time to say let us wate @ a few more months ] or we need more consessions now is the time to launch negotiations with % jupan ]
we cannot accept that our! twooway ] trade with the world's ~ third ] largest national economy is only a cortor of our trade with the % euse ] or % china ]
to ensure this i included a provision that if % japan ] has not delivered on its antib commitments and has not demonstrated sufficient ambition in meeting the % eu ]'s priority demands the commission should stop negotiations after consultations with the ` european parliament ] and the ` council ]
the commission has estimated that nearly! two thirds ] of these gaines of the % eu ] strate policy would come from potential agreements with the % us ] nd % japan ]
yes @ two days ago ] something happened! one ] port and the * sonnar airport ] we reopen but it is far from being enough
we have to put productive things on the table
i thin you struggle and i think you do everything you can but ou also have to odmit that some times some countries are blocking
% poleand ] are now going to be president so we need to put maxmume pressure on % pole ] and to live up to that responsibility
this is why we cannot wake til @ two thousand and twenty ] this is why it s all very well that we will get a legally binding agreement in @ two thousand and fifteen ] but the cop process needs to create other results long before that
this will only happen if the % eu ] shows direction and to be honest we have not done that for @ a few years ]
& ncan ] i ask you! one ] question commissioner
w i it that! one ] country can block progress for the % european union ]
this will only happen if the % eu ] leads
normally we are very polight and i not mention them but @ today ] woul like to mention % poland ] unfortunately because % poland ] has been blocking
i value you work commissionr
it will seriously help help us speed up the pace of negotiations and give the global climate agreement that chance
which is very much in line with the commission's own policy and estrategy
the ` euroean commission ] has recently provided help to the ) hungaran ] government in order to manage the flose of migrants enterin the country
it should at least make sowe that the gates are not closed to people that are not having budgges
that is called investment
in hungry i suppose that in the good old days when tey were still runing newspaper ads in order to sell their pasports the money had to be transfered into an offshor account that apparently belonged to the government
te is no pasport and no citizenship by investment
% isat ] is citizenship by identification integration ) merrit ] belief in what we stand for as nations and as % european union ]
si i know that the commission has limited means of action in this but condem the practice pleasd as clearly and as unequivacally as this house does because only thenweare going to get the more reluctant member states to realise that what they do is & rong ]
unfortunately even the change is introduced by committe you do not go far enough in improving the proposal
i am baffeled at the notion of extending the term of copy right whether its to @ seventy years ] or @ ninety five years ] and i am baffled by it not just becausei its jubious an almost out of step with the digital age but also because quite clearly a move like that will primarily
so i believe not with standing all of the hard work and good will that meps should reject this proposal
it is a proposal which i believe will ultimately reward those artists that are al ready successful and indeed reword the industry
i think the commission needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with the right proposal one that is not just about supporting prerformers in artist but that in real and practical terms will deliver precisely that
} foall eraky ] citizens in general and % te ] turkemen ] in particular because they have been numerously targeted on a luget scale
this attack clamed the life of a further! forty two ] ethnic tworkmen and onded another
therefore the % eu ] should work closely with the ) irakic ] government and use all the tools and it at its disposal to encourage the ) iracic ] government to provide adequate protection to the ) turkmen ] and other minorities
this resolution is not just for the % turkment ] is for all the minority communities of ` erack ] who long for peace and security
& thos ] and! seventeen ] despite the findings of % irak ]'s own high commission for human rights which achknowledge that ) turkemn ] have been subjected to terrorism bonbing skid nappings and assasination nether the federal government of % erak ] nor the ) curtish ] regional government have done enough to provide security and protection
emission limits afrold } mobal masshienary ] mit not sound like the sxest subject but it is an important piece of the ` gugso ] when it comes to tackling air polution
then inconvenient truth for those who sout to argue the environment of benefits of a ) britan ] outside the % eu ] is that airpolution has an unfortunate habit of not respecting borders
rather than allowing manufacturears to undercut each others in a raise to the battom on environmental standards these ambitious and binding measures of & naremem ] will insue industry is manufacturing progressively cleaner engens for these mashiens which will go a long way to cleaning optoxicare polution in the % eu ]
over! one third ] of the % uk ]'s airpolution is blown in from across the ) inglish ] ) chalal ]
this proposal is a perfect example of how trade in a common market can also deliver environmental and health benefits for citizens

the % eu ]'s cap on bankers bonesses was challenged by the ) british ] government but largely supported by the ) british ] people just as they support action to make copay more accountable

rp demr president the single market is! one ] of the most tangible results of ) european ] integration and yet despite its significant achievements citizens consumers and businesses have become increasingly discatisfied with it as it often fails to coniint
the mam problem is that in the average citizen's ise the market is more concerned with vested interests than it is with their needs
we need to start working towards a fairer single market that is politicaly supported economically viable socially acceptable by ) teuropean ] citizens a market that stimulates sustainable economic growth and jop creation but also consider citizen's hopes fears and expectations
the ` commin ] report is an important step towards achieving a strong green knowledge based social market economy which by turning its focus back to its people will become a common asset of all its citizens reduce unemployment poverty in equalities social exclusion and wage tumping promotes respect of fundamental
therefore i urge meps to support report and in particular the measures aim that endorcing highly competitive social market economy providing consumers with the highest level of protection promoting innovative startops smes and social economic enterprises opposing abuses in the single market which are trying to sircomvent existing rules lower

we also count on the ` european parliament ] to make sure that the % eu ] voice is more videlly heard and we appreciate very much the outreach efforts that you have made in the past
in addition to the shert vision for long term action to mitigation and technology and adaptation the identification of appropriate means for financing eeffective and long term climate policies will be key in the % eu ] further deliberations
with the adoption of this package in @ a few months ] time the % eu ] will demonstrate that its commitment as well as its leadership in the global fight against climate change are as strong as ever
} bustanian ] hol ] has also sent the message that the current financial crisis is not to be seen as an obstacle for further action on climate change but it instead as yet another opportunity for transforming pofondl our economic system and moving firmly towards a low carbant economy
of course the % eu ] has repeatedly said that it will not settle for! twenty ] p we want to go for! thirty ] prs and therefore we hope for an ambitious global and comprehensive agreement in % copenheagon ]

as you know the work during the presidencyil focuse on the international negotiation process
their tireless efforts have greatly contributed towards shaping the % eu ] position on climate change
@ ju ] by the way i am leaving ` strase bok ] @ today ] flying % todaly ] discussing with the ) indian ] government and ) indian ] representatives ` n ]

the # copenhaging conference ] is now only @ ten month ] away @ thi december ] ` posnan climate conference ] agreed on a work programme for @ two thousand and nine ] with clearly identified steps towards % copenhagon ] the decision in ` posnane ] on the operationalisation of the adeptation fund represents an important step forward in the negotiations on the financing building block

as well as the et is concerned a single % eu ] cap wl the linerd downward traetory will be set octioning will be gradually introduced as the method of allocating allowances and moritoring reporting and verification will be strengthened
the check presidency intends to build on such important at achievements and to puresue efforts at international level towards a successful agreement in % copenhagen ] in @ december two thousand and nine ] in @ march ] the ` scond ] environment and late cofin ` ` council ] formention and the spring ` ` european council ] will be the ~ first ] opportunities for further developing the % eu ] position in this respect on the basis of theommission communication towards a comprehensive climate change agreement in % coenheagen ] which we have received @ a week ago ] and on the basis of & youript ]

let me be clear * european ] and integration can inde transform the politics and economics of candidate countries as it has done in my country but it cannot construct democratic legitimacy of states and their institutions
in this respect i am highly appreciative of commissioner bynear strong ommitment to take into account the citizens concerns and osperations
in my opinion the single market is not getting the political support urgently needed to ensuret does not become @ yesterday ]'s business
more political leadership on the single market from the precidents of the commission and ` council ] would go along way towards achieving a viable single market to surve as a catalist for economic recovery
we must not lose this political momentom and unica opportunity to revitalise the single market
i repeat that market integration is nota nireversible process and must not be taken for granted

in this situation trying to politicise this debate with different issues is a huge mistake ~ first ] because these! three ] countries are not in the same situation and ~ second ] beause the accession to shengen ] cannot be mixed with te cooperation and berification mechanism
the decision on the accession to shengen must be based on technical creitarian and delay based on political regions is simply unacceptable
as it was already said it is difficult to immagin the % european union ] @ today ] without ` chengen ]
this is a very tangible expression of our solidarity of the freedom an unity of ) european ] citizens and it brings a lot of economic benefits but not for ) europeans ]
ft that is about credibility if we as % union ] follow our own rules
~ second ] the economic benefits will bring benefits to all citizens of the % european union ]
instead of wasting money for internal controls we should strengthen through resources n enough financing the external borders of the % union ]
we often complain that ante ) ) european ] forces populas are using arguments against the ) europeanion ]
this is! one ] of the cases because it shows injustice to too many ) european ] citizens and now the ` european council ] has to do its job which is not performed and injustice has to be stoppeded
are you aware that the % united state ] % swetseland ] and % germany ] that are true and historic federations they do not have a single national constitutiency
are you aware that ths will reinforce the waigte of the big states because it is natural that in the ~ first ] places of ich list there will be ) natunal ] from the bigger states and this will pegide the position of % ireland ] % portu ]
this is ) igetis ] quite important
presdent i have! three ] su three messages! one ] for all colleagues! one ] for president } tosk ] and the other for the commission i will be very sharp very loud and very clear
t o say i am very worried with this idea of an extraordinary ` council ] on the composition of the ` european parliament ] this is a competence in the power of our ` parliament ] that then has to be approved by the ` council ] it is true but we have made a huge progress and igh as a professer ofe constitutional law
the ` council ] should be aware of thise in any case
for this reason the % european union ] must pay close attention to the deterirating human rights situation of the ` irakiturkment ] not only because it is our duty but also because this situation is directly associated with stability in the * lager middle east ] region
the ` european parliament ] resolution adopted on @ forteen omuch ] @ last year ] was a welcome step forward but not enough given the current situation today the cultural religious and economic damage inflicted on the ) turman ] population is still highly visible and cannot be ignored by the % european union ] we should not forget all the incidents which took place in the city of % whormato ] and ` c ]
pending conditions
over many years the ` udgency ] has demonstrated its capacity to provide education health relief and social services
the other one the european defence fund
the % european union ] is known as a soft power and this identity should be preserved and developd
i would like to stress that the intention to have more than! five billion ] * europea year ] for this fund request own resources for the % european union ]
corruption is not just a private matter that is why wey have to push governments and political and social bodies to fight for themselves against their internal structural corruption
things are not in line with those high standards in some or many of our member states we do not know how many
it is really very difficult to come into solution without knowing where these border is and what are the guarantees to eerside of wader to national security area so that we really can sae our citizens yes we have the high standards
i s very muche commission andthe ` council ] to provide us with this kind of clear nowledge what we mean by nacional security
we should continue to invest our efforts to guarantee the implementation of the existing tools and the full use of % eu ] initidicated to the fight against cyber threats
but we should also continue and intensifide work to provide for new and more comprehensive responses to the constently avalving challenges posed by this threat
the ` council ] remains fully committed toward censtrictively towards he adaption and effective implementation of concrete measures in that respect
@ today ] the presidency and the ` european parliament ] received key imput from the commission on its recommendations for the most challenging issues in the directive regarding scope and several aspects of implementation that real be instrumental in making the last remaining stry
with this directive the % eu ] is going into untared territory in attempting to make our new digital lives more safe and secure
this is admittably not an easy process as developing legislation on a highly technical issue & tha toach ] at the same time on national security is no easy task the ) lactkan ] presidency continues and will continue to work to make significant progress on this file by the @ end of june ]
we shall also continue our efforts towards introducing effective and creative practical preventive and conter measures that will go beyond the necessary legislative minimum
dramatic changes in the media landscape in particular the introduction of new technologies have resulted in an unprecedented flow of information
despite ) th ] ) raconian ] measures neither totaltarian regimes nor terrorists are able to firmly close the tap and fully prevent the information flow
media serve as a catualist for a rapid and effective global response and thus is wital to the survival of a democratic society
mr president i would like to say thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs because this negotiation procedure has not been the traditional i want thisyou want that let us meet in the mid
this report will then have a financial instrument that will make it profitable for ship owners to scrapp their ships legally
there has been a massive lobeing campaign against this proposal by treports but it is actually based on incorrect information
the money collected will go back to the sector if they follow the law
they have been warning against huge ad ministrtive burdens why the impact assessment said hat is a very efficient administrativ wayt an deal with this problem
so pleased support these financial instruments amendment! thirty one ] and! thirty two ] so we can negotiate with the ` council ] who stands ready to negotiate with us
this will require pro active interventions by member state governments
free market theology must not stand in the way of doing right by workers
so is the common refrain that we must learn the lessons of this economic crisis genuine
if it is then the case for fundamental change in % eu ] policy and indeed % eu ] treaties is now unanswerable and should be the stuff of % eu council ] deliberations
we need a new treaty for a new time
so i call upon the ` council ] to act according to legislation according to & de democracy ]
pda % % itna ] new technologies are rapidly changing the nature of the financial o
this presents massive opportunities for * europe ] and it is now up to ) us ] policy makers to make the right choices and create a condusive environment so that * europe ] can benefit to the full extent
fintack is often used to refer to a specific seen of stardops disrupting finance with innovation
this definition is not the one used in our report because it would exclude a large amount of relevant actors
instead & fintack ] may be understood as finance inabled by new technologies covering the whole range of financial services products and infrastructure
it also includes inter teck the use of new technologies in insurance and ractack the application of new technologies for regulatory compliance the current rise of & fintac ] comes after the origination of a number of different tchnological developments within a short timespan
namely artificial intelligence cloud computing and distributed leged technology
these provide new opportunities for disruptions like mobal payments open banking croud funding criptal currencies and robo advice
fintack can lead to significant benefits such as cost reductions efficiency gains and more transparency
it can be also an effective tool for financial inclusion opening up high level services for those that could not afford them before
further more fintack can enable cross border financial flows and infrastructure through alternative lending and investment chanels
the # fintec ] revolution that we are currently experiencing is global
the bulk of these investments was made in the % united states ] and also % asia ] and % isrel ] are gearing up in this respect
the % us ] % china ] and % israel ] phosed more than! half ] of the top! ten ] largest ` fintek companies ]
if * europe ] wants to remain competitive rapid innovation should be the norm not the exception
this is not only important for * europe ]'s financial infrastructure but also for the real economy with consumers and businesses benefiting from improved financial services
not with standing all the benefits ` fintac ] also confronts us withe essential questions of a regulatory society nature
consumer protection and the stability of the financial system should be key concernds in this regard
together with the competitiveness of the ) european ] economy they make for the core priorities of this report
the report does not intend to give technical solutions
however it does intend to pose the right questions
that should be ta ~ first ] step in the process of creating a forward looking ) european ] policy in the area of financial technologies
the intention of this report is not to propose specific legis legislative actions
we must be cautious with creating new rules because much is still unclear about future developments of financial technologies
a better point of departure is investigating where current legislation causes uncertainties or barriers and identifying where additional action is necessary
doing this purposefully requires a whollistic approach as technological developments in our digitising society call for breaking cylers
fintack actors are already breaking ) scylos ] themselves
often they offer products in a diverse multiparty conjunction
i have some minits left at the end i will use the time then
t o on with any kind of dicital services we have to have very strong common simple understandable data protection regulation
i very much hope that in cooperation between the commission and ` parliament ] we can make als clear toe ` council ] that the package of data protection is crucial for the development of te ditial single market
) romap ] people has been suffering all through the ) european ] history but also the situation has never been better
@ today ] we have an opportunity to give prosperity to allf the people of * europe ]
please address that in your eply and do not continue to attack the people that are moving crossborders
in addition with the implementation of a harmonised ) european ] approach making these wepsightes accessible also has the potential to be a highly profitable business
the directive now covers all % eu ] public sectors bodies ) swepsightes ] and websightes providing public services as laide down in a new anne
this directive is essentially a forrunner in the & plan european accessability act ] which i know is } aso ] being egally awated by our citizens
the specifications for the accessibility are technology neutral and based on the international wep content accessbility guidelines
in our increasingly ditical world accessability is very much a human right all people are intitled to use the internet in order to exercise their fundamental rights
less than! one third ] of * europe ]'s public sector and government wepsightes and even less than! ten ] of * europe ]'s websihs ind general are fully accessable
however despite the fact that assistive technology already exists * europe ] has been legging far behind
in * europe ] this amount to! eighty million ] citizens with disabilities and another! eighty seven million ] aged over! sixty five one hundred and sixty seven millionpen ] citizens is! two ]o great a number to be ignored throughout my involvement with thedos i have seen what these people face when trying to navigate their way online it was particularly i was particularly struck by the difficulties faced by the blind which was exemplified at an ` imco ] committehering held in & apral ]
we are the % european union ] we should be setting the agenda not struggling or even failing keep to keep up
making wepsightes and their contenvusable for all should have already become a priority at % eu ] level
this piece of legislation is long over d and } egarly ] awated by both citizens with disabilities and are increasing aging population who finds themselves more and more isollated and excluded from a world wher information is accessible primarily online
the ` imco committe ] was more ambitious and made a number of significant amendments to the text
i am sure the ) greek ] presidency will follow up the good work on this file it is completely feeasable that the ) etalian ] presidency will be able to bring this doti into legislation
the scope along with the enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems reflects the binding obligations set out in the ` un ] on the rights of persons with disabilities and the commitments made in the & digalat agenda ] for * europe ]
the financial benefits are currently estimated at! two billion ]
however i thank ` th ] commissioner } cs ] for having openly supported our legislative work using! one ] of the most modern ways of rapid communication twit
however this is only the ~ first ] step in the legislative process we regret the lack of engagement of previous presidencies on this dos
it is both an efical issue and ta commercial issue
it is about basic and fundamental human rights and it is about jobs
in the speech you said that after @ a year ] of work in another country the country in which e frontiear worker had worked should be financially responsible for the payment of unemployment benefits
the guiding principle behind this is that a ) frontiare ] worker should receive benefits from the country in which he orshe has contributed
this is fair for everybody you said
i completely agree with this principle therefore commissioner i would like to ask you @ tonight ] if you think that this principle that a person should receive benefits from the country in which he has contributed should apply for not only frontiar workers but all mobile workers within the % eu ]
you mention that there are differences between the countries in youth and employment i % wou ] mentione % spain ] an
the aim is to undermine the work of legislators such as % us ] and at the same time mis leaset consumers
leaving! millions ] of fradhelant cars on our ods more than @ two years ] after the # desal gate scandal ] and our committed work in this ` parliament ]
in our economy m commissioner and in our society no private company no sector they may be the largest they may have a lot of people working & tha ] but none of them should be allowed act as they do today as the cureindustry dos today because then they think & themselve ] of
t e would follow your order and receive migrants and refugees in my country hungry you as well as every single person in this room now perfectly well that those people would not want to stay in hungry because they want a better life
what is the ` orderso ] to say in this respect
we all know very well that we cannot put these people into a close institution
they have the right to freedom of movement
i know we should intergrate then
this will be probably le answer but this is } ha rall gan ] to } mirtimamans ] and thercolleagues because they would not like to be integrated in hungery they would like to move on the next day to richer countriesso you must have a strategy on that because your call strategy about the treatment of the migrant crisis
we are in a position to presure human government more to open up
implementation and informment or fundamental for our future
a good application of %eu ] law is basic in order to regain the support of our citizens and increase the efficiency of our monitary union
to ensure this before talking about more integration
the @ two thousand eleven ] & anal ] report on % iceland ] clearly demonstrates % iselands ] advanced level of preparation the closure of! eight ] negotiation chapters is most welcome but the challenging negotiations are yet to come and i mean her chapters such as fisheries and agriculture which will need special attention given that circumstances in % iceland ] are different from those of other ) european ] countries
greater importance should also be given o negotiations on chapters such as regional policy the environment and the economic and monitory policy i saw that according to the recent poll the majority of ) icelanders ] still oppose % eu ] membership since @ sixty sevenare ] against only! thirty three ] in favour of accession but myemarkis that in @ the last year ] to support for the % eu ] and both candidate and member states has been very low and therefore % icelands ] should continue to remain committed to the conclusion of the accession tok
the legislator define both & manatara ] information and vol voluntary information consumers making information a crucial point of the legislation
it is critical that consumers have access to complete information in order to make an informd choice
the resolution of the ` fishery's committee ] discusses the commission servy control of @ two thousand and fifteen ] which analises the conformity of labling with the legal requirements of wild fishing retaile
however numbers are worrying for some species for which the level of conformity is very low common species are substituted for more expensive species
it could help in the creation of an external structure wh } wic ] scrutinises the scertificiciation of voluntary claims including on the lable of fishery and agricultural products
i would also like to remind the commission that ` parliament ] is still awating the commission report on the possibility to defigne and establish minimum criteria for the creation of an % e % eu ] eolabl for fisher in & aqriculture ] products
further information on fish can be added to & alable ] as an addition to compulsery information
member states must implement sanctions which are efficient proportionate and deswasive
compulsary and correct information must be available for consumers all the way through the chain including diners and restronts
it deals with voluntary information on fishery products and aims at creating and up to date an exaustive inventory of voluntary claims associated with the fishery and aqicultura products which are marketin n the % european union ] whatever their origin
the commission is currently working on the implementation of a pilat project proposed by `h parliament ] @ last year ] and my regards to our char r ` cadeca ] could not be here @ today ]
this inventory will enable analysis of the certification systems of these claims
it is also necessary that such information be reliable meaning it must be controled in a very strict manner
this information canabl consumers to have complementary information s such as he data cach dat of landing more information on fishing ar the flag state information on the netritional value of the product environmental ethical or social information
in a separate study from @ last year ] on labeling in restrance in % brussels ] including the % eu ] cantems the endon of } cianna ] estimates mislabeling at! thirty two ] overall whete he mislabling rate in % bloufin ] % tuna ] to be! eighty ] this observation brings us to ask member states to enforce the existing law
~ first ] and for most member states have to reinforce controls in order to identify fraud and the missing links in the supply chaing for fishery and agriculture products which lead to mislabelling or fraud
it is the duty of member states to guarantee that this information is available and acurate
we are awating this external structure and hope that this information will be easily accessable to consumers
the publication of this report is a requirement of the common market organisation for fishery and aqriculture regulation
this is often the case for ) bloufintuna ]
compulsary information is the following commercial designation of speecies and its scientific name the production method and fishing ear the area where the product was caught or produced and the clear indication where the product whether the product was a defrosted this manatory information applies both to retail and supply forcators and restrants
restronts must always keep the information which they receeved when they both the product in case consumers or state authorities ask for them
i think we need to promote public awareness and online safery especially among children but also with parents so that they know exactly what is going on an what can be done on the internat
it is a wonderful source of information for all of us thand it is something that i is going to be part of our lives into the future however there are those who pray on children and they will use the internet as much as they possibly can to try und undermined children
i thinke member states should work together to introduce a network of contact points for the public to reach a report illegal and hareful content and conduct
if i could turn to activity based budgeting and management i the commission has made huge programps on this but i would warn against overpur cratising this exercise because what we want to ensureter qualitif evaluation not simply ticking boxes
tis will allow us to get a much clearer idea of our policy perspectives on top of the commissions and your work programmes
mr president out of this budget review we simply have to ask ourselves! one ] question does the budget reflect the political priorities of the # twengy first ] century if it does not need changing
an is it flexible enough to reflect changing times
we ` owo ] what people spending all their time inre valueating themselves when they should be getting on and doing some work
% th ] left in the budget because we cannot change things because of the restrictions of the mf f
now it is about university it about engos it is above all about the next national consultation
we have witnessed an attempt an attakt a vage idea to reintroduce the death panalty and all that coming from a man who is constantly refering to ) christian ] values
the only thing that comes to mind me in all this context is i all } forein ] influence is so bad why do you eccept the payment of! five billion ] annually as the big net recipient of ) european ] structural funds in order to plaster the whole country with the postersn which you call % brussel ]'s crap
somebody who does that fram minister } leavs ] the % union ] out of their own acourt
we have witnessed several unspeakably worded national consultations in the meantime
the ) ango ] think prime ministry is not about transparency as we all know it is in order to lable angos that are forein funded as forrin because they might carry forein influence into % hongere ] an % forein ] influences bad
it is & capes me ] prime minister where the debt penalty would be on any ) christian ] agenda and have rarely found an your ) christian ] geologion who would hav been able to find anything good about the & det ] penalty
when was the last time a! million ] people marche through the streats of the ) european ] capital demanding more % eu ] integration
it is also a moment of trut for our policy in the * eastern neighbourhood ] and i would there to the biggest tese of the % eu ]'s performance as a ge political actor capable of defending its interests and values in the immediate neighbourhood
i fully shar ` parliament ]'s sense of urgency to make progress on this proposal
i therefore welcome the proposal of the ` budget committee of the ` european parliament ] which proposes to restore most of the appropriations proposed by the commission in the draft budget
to % finteen ] we cannot afford the % eu ] budget being paralised we need to bring it under control and we have at this moment a ) nek ] opportunity to do so
i fully agree that we must act responsibly and addressed at this stage the means that we have in payments
however even if indeed further reenforcement contribute in increasing investments we should try and find the right balance with the implementation prospects and te payments availability
we should seease such opportunity to address the shortagh of payments appropriations in
all this has to be achieved withina very tight financial circumstances and very tighd budgetory cilings
we must also oner our obligations and pay op stending bil steming from past commitments thus avoiding unnecessary burden on beneficiaries
sustainable economic growth competitiveness the creation of jobs and te fight against % uth ] on employment ar over arging priorities of the % u ] policy and should be reflected in the orientation of the % eu ] expenditure for @ two thousand and fifteen ] we must this under a clear and agreed framework and provide the necessary predictability and security for our investments and our partners
e must put all our efforts in making this framework fully operational fully respecting all the terms of & dhis agreement ]
@ t funteen ] @ last month ] i a expressed before this house the commission's concerned about the position taken by the ` council ] in its reading of the budget @ two thousand and fifteen ]
exceptional additional revenue from & fina ] streeming from the enforcement of the competition policy means that the additional payment requests for @ two thousand and fourteen ] will be intotal at no cost for member state
the level of payment appropriations remains the ` pariamont ] concern that we need to address at the budget conciliation we must ensure that the legal obligations arising in @ two thousand and fifteen ] are met and put a stop to th snobal effect of shifting anever increasing amount of unpayed buils into future years
we must avoid artificial under budgeting in the future as we are now al aware of the problems that such an a approach brings
the reinforcements of payment appropriations proposed by the commission in amending ~ latter ber ]! one ] go in the same direction as a number of amendments proposed by the ` european parliament ] where the needs are mostpressing and i im particular with the aim of reducing the backlogue of & anpad buils ] and allowd the proper launching of the new programmes
in its draft budget the commission has proposed to use the full amount of payment appropriations under the mfseiling or
as oknow favorable developments on the revenue side in @ two thousand and fourteen ] provide an opportunity to find agreement in this direction
i have in mined for example the ) eu ] governant } mayers ] which has been contributed to our climate and energy objectives since
this is indeed where regions andthe cities should be when it comes to finding solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation they have proved to be ambitious forward looking and innovative so we need all of them on board
there will be no place for business as usual
i think it is very important
adoption is a wonderful alternative for otherwise and wantod children or a child that left in an unsafe environment
but what concerns me about this report is that its another powergrab by % brussels ] over the juristiction of family law
in the % uk ] there are there are strict laws about family courts including the privacy of proceedings for what is an aways will be a very emotive subject
but what i fear wilth this latest demand for more * europe ] is the best interests of the child maybe put ~ second ] to the % eu ]'s desire for more and more power
and what happens if itis a disputed adoption
if the & gram ] parents want to adopt
or! one ] parent is actually fighting the case
how will that work if the child is taken across another countriys border another culture or maybe where the child will be brought up speaking a different language
i believe that we all should be encouraging families to be strong and cohesive units which is the best environment for bringing up a child
w al a disagree with that just witness the political medling in the braxet process or a number of ) european ] general elections so indeed this is not just an issue for the * east ] to consider and this is not an issue for ` negto ]'s eastern flank this is a larger plat that we need to deal with the ~ second ] and ` probab ] much more important point is
the report makes reference and emphasises rightly the security defende and political challenge that % russia ] provides for the % european union ]
much as i would like to avoid this we cannot simply support this vile as it stands now
the is an obligation for biolateral individual response between member states
} ry muh ]
i do not think i need to remind my honourable colleagues that that particular article is not a traditionally understood as an obligation for collective response
but they will do so only when ) ukraneans ] manage to fulfill & ultiagreed ] and outstanding condition
i believe that our common gole is to help % ukraine ] but it is true that we need to closely follow the situation
a step into the right direction is the adoption of the law on high andte corruption court is @ last week ]
ts } n thourteen ] this time the commission proposes! one billion ] to be dispersed as * mediom ] and # longm bloans ]
~ third ] to reform process which has been important but is not really steaded until now
therefore it is crucial that a! two ] unfulfild ) anty ] corruption measures will be pout of the new conditions
this memorrandom sets out to supporting policy measures which are conditional for the dispersements of the funds
ther being said to address any dout that may arise during this debate mf is not an unconditional support
~ first ] to personing conflict and casualities in the * eastr ] of % ukraine ] andto ] halte ` evri ] socio economic consequences of this egration
~ second ] the economic recovery which remain % frega ]
if corruption is not addresseddresicdressigly and mifai fund should not be delivered to % ukraine ]
in that context i would like to highlighte! three ] key elements
they are firm conditions to ensure that this money willselve to the economic stabilisation and t the support of the reforms no it is very important to remind that the commission ` council ] the last tranch of the ttmfa programme when some % ukraine ]'s commitments were not fulfilld
in addition to newly adopted law who asigned @ yesterday ] by the president of % ukraine ] i welcome rapporteur welcomes this news with great satisfaction it means that ) eukraneians ] stake the commitment seriously
the assistance is also intended to triger reforms in % ukraine ] which is done by agreeing with the ) ukranean ] authorities a memorrandom of understanding
hence twe need for support to these reforms inte context where many interest can play against especially in a @ pre election years ]
in other words it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation this is the firt t fort time that the commission proposes an mf tou % ukraine ] since the beginning of towar in
if we are serious about our * gol ] we cannot slow down to procedures
i am very grateful that we are where we are now indeed % ukraine ] needs this * seport ] and it deserves this eport and i think it is very appropriate to have this next programme now
rateful to the commissioner that you although it is not included in the joint declaration you explicitly refer to that because thatit is what it is also about
we need to be very clear in this regard
however the iturnally crucial lestue remains that of the implementation
m president you cannot sharve your money and spend it you cannot have your kik and eat it you cannot pretend to be a nation n o
the % european union ] despite what it likes to think is not a nation
it follows that it cannot be and should not be a parti to such international agreements this want and many others
hapily we have the perfict opportunity to play it and play it repetedly
we the % united kingdom ] are permanent members of the ` united nations security council ] we must not give this up quite crunched country that we must start to make better use of it
this mange using it to appose block and even veto behaviour on international treaties conventions and agreements which are against our interest there is a clear % uk ] message here for the % european union ] } youtin ] you hold au cads
you } dan ]
our hand is potentially a lot better than you understand
what the % uk ] has to do however is to understand itself how good our hand is and then be prepared to use it
if the ) british ] government is we anything at all those who play hard bob with us should and i hope will find that we can play hard bol with them
it could form ta bluprint for radical change yet without decreasing funding going to newer member states i have called for the ) uk ] government to include these open * europe ] proposals in their reform and re negotiation discussions we re talking about a ~ third ] of the % eu ]'s total budget
i is quite difficult to explain breafly but it is about not shuffling money around from one country to another and not particularly that largegal recipient countries give money to the commission that the commission then gives them back and tells them what to do
rather it is focusing on countries like yours and situations like yours so that cohesion achieves sustainable economic growth and list people out of that situation for the benefit of everybody within the % eu ] on a limited basis not forever
it will be an unnecessary collection of muc of information about travellers whoc are completely innocent
tw have to delead the data after the excet unless ther is a risk or suspition so what we expect from the ) cannadian ] authorities with regard to our citizens we should also respect with regard to citizens of othertert countries like % caneda ]
we are not fixing the system which is not working because some of the member states authorities are not ) thoroly ] working with the system feeding ino information to the system some of the auteborders
we have to check the pasports and thats exactly what we are doing
this system you do not get track of any vise ovestea in the ` european ununion ]
stop basshing hungry stopp preaching us about solidarity and talk about solidarity to those strong healthy % yong ] ) syrian ] and other men who should go home and revieild their countries
but at the same time you know that people are tired of words and promises and it is time for action from the ` commisson ] as well and the strongest tool which you posess as a commission is the project the draft of your budget or the next multianial financial framework we should stop thinking how to reduce the ) european ] budget
o but look for own resources
we should really focus on political priorities and the measure priority is how to move from * europe ] of divergence in equalities towards * europe ] of convergence and strong economic growth and social justice
this means that life or people in * europe ] is better and this is what people expect from us
i agree and i appreciated it
in some cases a sertificat of legality will only be a starting point the ~ first ] measure included in the dudligence procedure
~ firstly ] i would like to refer to the du deligence approach which is more comprehensive than just a difficat of legality
when the risk assessment has shown that the country afforigy ffore itimpresents highe risk of administrative corruption or in countries where enforcement of national laws is wik additional guarantees arenecessary to underpeenthecertified legality
the principle of du deligence reflects the legal obligation of a prouctive behavioure to acertain legality need to be demonstrated on a basis of comprehensive measures which will enable legality to be resonably assured
we should keep in mind that patterns of tropical deforestationare the result of the interaction of a number of different factors which very an importance in different locations
in the % european union ] we understand that working on the coherence of our policies must go handing hand with supporting countries in their efforts to strengthen national and local institutions and make progress towards effective governance and guse of or resources ) ish ] i wish to thank again
encourage ` th parliament ] while endorcing the approach of the commission wants to reinforce it further and has made amendments to this end
i also want to assure you that the commission will give careful consideration to the amendments of the proposed regulation
this is what they mean
moreover ` w ] will investigate any barriers that may prevent consumers from suching to better offers
we also sink that a single market for t tel financial services which can rely on in innovative solution i very welcome
a high level of environmental protuction is of course of the highest priority for the commission
the developing countries have delivered th we ask them for a radm up to legal binding global agreement
i think that when it comes to such sensitive topics we cannot afford to clacify them industrict catagrees such as % eu ] internal and % eu ] external issues because terrorist actions might be plened outside the % eu ] but can seriously affect the people living inside the % eu ]
i your % portforia ] a no poverty reducing in equality decent work
olet me conclude
it is a ` ciione ] on for the future of our planet and for the future of our people
andyou could say we in time of fake neose it is good to have dart
therefore reaching the sustainable development golt within the % eu ] is vital
it says that we are making progress we are moving in the right direction
mr president t ` international energy agency ] just recently pos the report saying that the developed countries of this world the industrialised countries have about @ five years ] to change fundamentally they way they produce energy and they way hey consume energy
in order us to stay below a! two ] degree increased in temporature
now if we do not stay below! two ] dagrees we know what will happen
then if we look at what has actually now been pleged by the same countries the countries that need to change fundamentally @ within five years ] it is unfortunately very very dissatisfying
w se the situation now whet ha pledges re about! half ] of what we need in order to reach our * tarkeg ]
we all know that we will not get a full legally binding agreement with regard to mitigation in ` derblan ] that would solve these problems but we know also that we have possibilities to pursue targets that are ambitious non theless targets that & wil ] get us closer to our final goal
this is why we have a moral obligation to help them financially
the fact that that is colder here now is also quite prodictable because if the gulf streame is pressed down by melt water from the * arktic ] this is anexplainable effect
it has to do with a very important argument on democracy
% capatar ] course problems inside member states in national transport
% ow ] we are limeting it to @ two days ] fer member states and it will be posting from day! one ] nomatic driving drivers have a new right to go back home by the end of maximume @ three weeks ]

this is! two ] ways red
you need to understand what it meansthe universally applicable collective agreements if you oppose the mandate
} manimn gates ] might becom a new no and use i all be aware of that
currently we do not have a common % eu ] } minuman ] wats level in transport and the posting of & triverse directive ] is not the right tole to do that
it is totally anouthor discusson
we need a rich content of information and to facilitate access to information which could improve our lies and lead to concrete economic growth
we should have a better guarantee and have a better look on the additionality
there we have to support these countries to have a better capacity to take it up quality to make projects and investment banks as ` mycollea ] said
it has to do with a very important argument on democracy
all acense of scase is no longer thus ar judicial or political one
he should be immediately aan conditionally released on humanitarian rount
it is now a matter of human comperition
% capatar ] course problems inside member states in national transport

} dafnegalicia ] was known internationally was known globally for her fight against corruption she reported on the corruption
& multa ] is gografically and historically! one ] of the gats and one of the dars of the % european union ]
she reported on the ) pannama ] papers and we have seen we have read we have heard and we could not egnore ) panamar ] papers are directly implicated with some ) maltis ] authorities
it should be the basting of the protection of human rights rule of law independence of judicial power and impasaly of criminal prosecution
to the commission and to the ) malts ] authorities is to grant respect and observation of the rule of law
but similar concern and wishful dialogue in relation to % spain ] is not shown by the ) european ] institutions inspite of having ther } mortin ] strong signals of briaches of the rule of law of democracy and a fundamental rights
point! five ] expresses confernd about the rule of law democracy and fundamental rights including freedom of the media and independence of the policean judiciary
) tis ] government is imprisen the other! half ] inexile
i am ashamed and we all should be ashamed because without this killing we would never know here what happens in # multa journealist ] being ` aas ] denounceet and even & il ] media houses being blackmail by banks respected of money landering and tax ivation
high government officials suspected of being implicated also in the same operations and police authorities refusing to imvestigate those allegations because they have been appointed by! anhalf ] economic and personal tipes with the government
we cannot remain silent so @ today ] we ask for! three ] concrete actions ~ first ] we want the commission to immediately launch a rule of law dialogue with & multa ]
~ secondl ] we want e ) maltic ] authorities to investigate and to prosecute money landering no matter the names or the ranisations implicated
on ~ third ] we want an independent and international investigation into the killing of } dafhne carouan gallisia ] we have to say lowd and clear that * europe ] values and principles are much more important than money
* europe ] is about justice about separation of powers and about the rule of law
} tehy ] knows that
* bt europe ] is also about freedom transparency and truth
the legislation to implement beanr has been submitted to our ` parliament ] and is being discussed in our house
taxation is a key element of the political systems and our democracies and in the treaty they are therefore part and i believe rightly so part of the member states competencies
t s very happy tat you mat that point and we have to work on that
i did not mentiond t in my speech but the same bay for the same work and the } cirman ] in the same type of circumstances is at the core of the belief of the ) deat ] government and we will push for that
there can be no doubt nd i am happy that i know that the whole commission is behind this
ma not for you personally but this is happening at the moment
yes we are working on new alliances within the % eu ]
thanks to the free market! hundreds of millions ] of people in the @ last ten fifty years ] have been lifted out of poverty world right
oe forradical reform
our defence it is crucial ta keep the dialogue with ` h united states ] going even if within that family relationship we have some serious quorels at at a moment
wehave to do this collectively
in many cases as we all know } dever muc ] disagree and that helps the debate also in those areas
youl have this big house her
% union ] and i am absolutely convince that in those days she would fully agree with what i have just stated
~ secondly ] on migration i here @ today ] reach out my hand to & itally ] because i know that they have to deal with a extremely difficult situation
thank you all for participating in this debate
i am absolutely convinced we cannot just say there are new tasks which have to be funded and at the same time we cannot find savings in the existing budgets and that is the plea i am making here that is exactly what all the member states have to do an just saying we have to ` goto ]
o many questions i cannot answer all of them but have tried to bring them back to basically for key issues
this is also my answer to mr } brasshier ] on this issue betterguarding our borders and working on better return mechanisms for rejected ) ousilam seakers ]
but i also egually awate the ) italian ] government's national measures because they have to do a lot to better manage the inflowe of illegal mirgrets and then they know that we stand ready to show solidarity and also as a % european union ] to work collectively to address this issue which will be with us for @ the years to come ]
i believe social affars have to state a national level but when social affairs have a cross border impact that also * europe ] needs tog nolved
we also have to remain focused and this is crucial on structural reforms
t time that the ` council ] fingers not those who act like the new government in % spain ] but to those who do not act
} umberto ] the question cannot be externalised and the answer cannot be simply repressive
e e olistic and preventive
but then you have to explain is how this is compatable this giant external % european union ] with an internal darf % european union ]
these is not sustainable
n let me put a final question do you really believe that! one ] of budget! one ] of ` ggp ] is the fasttrac the big way for the big government of ) european ] institutions
lease be reasonable
% eih ] about! eight ] ofal ] the new jobs and the % european union ] have % bein ] created by smes andn my own constituency ofe doubling about! four hundred ]! zerd ] people are employed by aout! one hundred ] & zerd ] companies in the sme sector
the challenge that we have at the moment is about jobs jobs jobs and we must bend over backwards to try and protect existing employment and hopefully in @ the years ahead ] trying create new jobs
that is absolutely essential for all of us
if we want to get our small businesses and get employment to stabilise in the % european union ] and in our each individual member states we must do everythingwe possibly can to try and save them
we must do all we possibly can at the moment to support these companies in difficult times
the sectors most effected are mining extractive industries agry business wh thrugh electric temps and water rights and logging
! tousa ] and! fifteen ] in @ two thousand and sixteen ] there were around! four ] murders @ pweek ] and this murder restraint went on in @ this year ]
the % eu ] and its member states are clearly not doing enough to ensure coorperate accountability and legal redress
this annual report concludes includes strong language on the strinking space for civil society including the call for an % eu ] monitoring mechanism for cases of violations of freedom of assembly and association
environmental human rights defenders like here under threat when they opose the interest of cooperations and governments
% hungory ] where one can witness cronism at its # finast ] is a perfect example to thedemonstrate this problem
~ first ] introduction of targeted measures against individuals responsible for grave human rights violations and ` h ~ ~ second ] providing active support or scyvil society groups and defenders of human rights i would like her to extend our simpathy and support for ) aranea ] people who have since @ the end of last year ]
this is coming back to us after successful conclusion of the negotiations and i would like to thank the ` shadorapporters ] and the commission ` aso ] for its assistanceanc facilitating this deal which actually put demands on facilities so that the practice known as beaching is not % evany ] more possible and that is a great step forward
when you look at the situation in % greece ] its difficult
of course a low of the things in that agreement between the % union ] and the member states and % turkey ] har have to be dealt with and have to be elaberated on those individual aspects will of course when it is legally bound to be dealt with with the proper institutions
the border will not be opening again
we need to work full speed on a ) european ] bordergard system on revision of % dublin ] and on a more structural ) european ] solutions
the solution it is an outline of possible solutions and it is the beginning of the implementation and hard work that has been done and has to be done
he % u cnot ] survive being at se so ` yo ] have to engage with the other country on the otherside you have to engage with countries on the otherside of the external borders so ou agreement with % turkey ] was necessary in any case
other thinks to be biller from screth
we are seeing improvements wer seeing positive effects already but we also realise that our lot has to be done
t e government is doing what they can to help and member states are supporting it
a part of the waydealt with it before has engos doing the foods
bute! one ] thing has to be clear theythe are only solution is to apply for asylum in % greece ] get into that system and offer themselves up for relocation
in our position not an agreement within the legal meaning of & article two hundred and eighteen ] of the treaty
it offersus new challenges that are more manageable than the old ones that we have to face @ last year ] but they are still challenges and they still lead to a lot of work and the lot of improvement that we are doing on a day by day and week by week basis
it is fully clear that they have a right to be heard the have a right to ar procedure they have a right to an appeal they are process regularly
& dhat ] has happened and lot of work has to be! one ] in practice to improve theply to the people on the reception facilities and also get this new system of readmission started
we are also combining it with getting more of a grip on who iscoming to the ) european ] member states for protection and whos offered protection in the region and in % turkey ]
aware that there is a risk of other roots and that we have to work heard on finding solutions to prevent those roots from leading to large imfloc posing member states with a of issues andhe most horably having the refuges an the migrants b regular or not putting their lives of great risk again and
we also commend the hard work being done on the ) turkish ] side for improving the situation of the refugees the } harber ] a $ harber ]! millions ] there so itis a lot of work but also the legal safegards and the legal position of those people is improved by % turkey ] which helps us enormously making this agreement work and having a better solution than we had before
% ee ] improvements everyday but we fully realise as he member states an as ` council ] that we are not % thare ] yet and the lot has to be done
s i think that is the biggest benefit we can } aleady ] see from these agreements
of course other member states have to do a lot as well
let me say from fom the ` council ] perspective and a member states perspective this is not a perfict solution but it is the best solution that we can find right now
fortunately for the time being it seems to me that we are not onhe way to reduce this uncertaininty
# brexsit ] is an unfortunate reality but we have to move on
we i think i should refrache that most of us believe in a future * europe ] that up holds the fundamental value of solidarity on issues like migration and in a * europe ] that strives to guarantee the safety and security of its citizens
we must use as a basic platform the established principles respect for human rights and dignity freedom equality and rule of law
any progress registered on the future of * europe ] must be followed up and translated into action
having spent almost @ nine years ]self in this institution i know how crucial and meaningful ` parliament ]'s continuous trol and participation is in this defining moment for the future shaping of the ) european ] project colleagues we need to draw on this momentm and } calvanise ] and } energiyise ] our forces to forge a stronger better union
we believe that success belongs to those who can harness positive forces that unite rather than devide
the current indicators show that we have once against tarted to register successus we believe that the % union ] should be should be robastly position to shape and manage better globalisation not mearly reactoit
this could pave the way for the eventual arosion of the unity
a strong * europe ] is needed to bring aboutth right balance in a world order which is shifting
some options sumit sem to be more attractive than others and who knows there may be other options which have not yet been brought to the table
we must face up to the reality that the ) european ]'s horisons has shifted
having said that reform does not mean a whole redesigne of * europe ]
we have a fragile balancing act to follow abalance between flexibility which is not so lose as to threattein the meaning of a real union and in transiten ratidity which would undermind the whole process of the ) european ] project
were believe in creating better conditions for growth jobs and for higher living standards through the % union ] single market
these are the values that reflect the sole of the % union ] and form the % cau ] of any future * europe ]
yes we are living in times of extraordinary unpredictability and it would be a big mistake to underestimate the major sat b set backs and challenges but it would be an even bigger mistake to fall into a neg negative mindshet and resin our eselves to doing nothing
the % european union ] is not about % brusseles ] it is not aout % strassborg ] nor is it about the institutions to which many of us involved into dayes debate # elong ]
never has there been a more important time for member states and the institutions to remain united never has there been a crucial time for all of us to focus on the big picture and trut out potentially distracting unnecessary devisive issues
t not thinking common with the democracies of * europe ] and therefore % turkey ] should never ever be allowed to join the % european union ]
but they were men and women of their time as it is a treaty of its time
because what began as a noble economic plan has morted into a political monster eked on by successive eurocrats who are hungry for ever more power and determined to destroy the nation state
andwhat continues to amase me is that you levellern
} youae ] talk about an exestential crisis but you say what even is even more % eu ] you are fidling whilst the & treaty of role barns ] so what i will say is simply this i & argou ] caution when you are selebrating @ next week ] because & brexic ] could trigger a foo gate whereby other countries leave that same treaty you are selebrating @ next week ]
} todavibsack ] and } straly ] i just want to say that you have many friends in this ` parliament ] and we will not stay ) sylent untill ] the } d david isack ] is back home in % sweeden ] in safety
dreaming and peacefully acting for democracy must never be a crime
@ for nineten years ] his wife and his children have tried to do everything they can to get him relieased
it is something } ratan aroten ] in a world when people can be geed and in worst cases we deprived their lives just because they dream of a better society a better world
~ first ] & enformus ] i want to thank all my colleagues for a good cooperation that has made this resolution possible and urgency that talks about real people's lives because oppression and injustice are not only words
maltilutaking wisely! onee ] said in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
furthermore the ` council ] legal service has been requested to provide an opinion and the presidency is now waiting for this opinion before continuing the discussion
madam president } honbers ] thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to deliver on behalf of the commission as statement on the most rime too project i know that these continues to be a subject to which many of you attach a high importa
! three ] different approaches to the mandate can be distinguished a dicerstate in the ` council ]
a number of ta
~ first ] there is a significant number of member states which are clearly in favour of the mandate
efficient in our support and let me touch a couple of things the commissioner also said about it
this is combining healp and wone hand emergencys the commissioner said and prevention for the future
support for people and also for the future
he can be aombination of those toos
i think the biggest thing is that we are abling things to happen
we need to share info and for that we need all the platforms where we can easily sare the information and also where we can share the big data which is very important with the & ict ]
understood
it was incredibly complicated time
so instead of ` ect blaiming ] and criticising especially personally some people at the ` ecb ] we should appreciate what they did for the way how our economy has got out of the crisis for the jobs they safed actually improved the situation i * europe ]
mr president } mtwo thousandand ] andhe ` european parliament ] voted for the single market to be percived as a hollistic unified project finding an equaliberiam between an open atm friendly economy and a citizen social and basic rights
however this proud place comes with responsibilities
ened to look further we need to address the major largecr political question as well
they have not got a cloe they do not have a plan they will continue giving ( billions of our money to the % eu ] and a completely split and whether to carry out the result of a ` fiarnot ]
the ` toris ] have a great hand nearly! forty billion ] pond over to the % eu ] as a punishment for having a democratic decision to leave
the ) thories ] have had @ two years ] to come up with the position on # brexsit ] and shows a blowprint of what an independent ) britin ] would look like
the recent commission statemen of estimates show that the % uk ] will be handend oer
thes citizen's charte would clearly outline citizens rights and obligation within the single market especially for ) european ] citizens want to move sell shop and work across borders the urgent need for such an initiative was confirmed by the commission's citizens stop! twenty ] concerns
the commission must now address these concerns by presenting the top! twenty ] solutions as soon as possible to restore the crucial variable of credibility among citizens to the market
these measures would correct consumers and esmes negative perception of the single market thereby boosting their participation in the market and reassuring the citizens that the % eu ] works for them
there is no way out and if you say if he sas well perhaps @ a month or too later ] i woill not accept
the situation in the deoracy is indeed terrible it has been this way for for quite a wile and i am deeply concerned about the handling of the current issue with regard to the } cazi provence ]
prepar the elections properly
think we should not accept anything unless there is really a broad consenses with all political stakeholders
i would like to see you } madahime ] representative despite your comprehensive explanations and the commission to take on an even more prominent role
of course we took the decision in @ september two thousand and fifteen ] for the package of ( bout four hundred and twenty million ] and of course it was don to directly support farmers and to see how we can leverage the supply and themond a member states aa commission ` c pubbely ] will say something about it
it is also clear that i t should be a joint effort a joint effort by the ` council ] by the ` europea parliament ] by the ` european commission ] but also by t producers themselves
the situation in the agricultural markets in many of the member states is very difficult and sever especially in the ) dairi ] sector and the ` council ] is fully aware of the this situation and do share the concerns of the farmers who have to cope with these difficult problems
that will be on the agenda for the ` dum council ] to be discussed by the ` council ] member states and the commission
i are still implementing those measures
in & mark ] we took! sixteen ] additional measures together with the ` european commission ] and the ` council ] and those measures relate to intervention measures relate to promotion measures to export as well as the possibility for member states to give additional state aid
but also in the # last council ] it was clear that many member states have stated that if we are going to take again additional measures they have to be linked to the reduction of the bilpproduction
you see efrage increase of the mil production of about between! five ] and! six ] but tit is not ) tha ] case in every member state so while stating that we need e ) european ] answer at the same time we need flexibility for the member states to implement measures which are sutable for the national circumstances
president i would like to thank all the members of ` parliament ] for their remarks but also for their suggestions and certainly the presidency will take them with us to our next discusstion in the ` council of jume ] because there we are going to discuss again of course te very severe situation in the ` irr ] sector
i would like to reiterate } bat ] was said by a commissioner } hopen ] that the commission and the ` council ] were not bressing on the loers
many measures have been taken not only i @ september ] but also in # marts ] and of course we see some effects of those measures perhaps not enough but there are effects of those measures and the situation could have been worse if we did not have taken those & thse ] measures
} ndyes ] i would like to reiterate that we need ) european ] approach
it is clear that the ` council ] also stated that we do not want to go back to a ) croata ] system and i agree with what was said by mr } hautoma ] that we have to improve the situation of the farmer in the supply chang ]
we have to give them a fair prise for thei products
therefore the work of the market taskforce instoled by the ` european commission ] is so important and in the ` jum council ] we will have the ~ first ] report of this tasforce and hopefully we get some interesting and creative ideas
but at the same time of course we have to support those farmers and to see how we can help them veloping supply and % emond ]
it is not the dougemode of the ) doug ] government but i is also the dougemodel of the ) doug ] dairy producers and they are looking into neas markets into improving quality intu new market conceps
e a ` lso ] now at this moment discussing possibilities of reduction of reduction of the melk production in the % nelanc ] on a voluntary basis and i think it is up to the ` council ] in @ jun ] to see how we can support those initiatives of farmers organisations to reduce the milk production
tis preciated and i believe we have come up with a good report
because the patranising atitude that we have had in the past has made us look ~ second ] or ~ third ] in line in terms of preference of many recipient states and that effects the notional validity of h partnership as well
! one ] of my amendments and supported by the rapportur refers to the fact that member states ` europol ] and ` euro ] just are not granted the possibility to communicate data to non member states and ~ third ] countries because of the absence of sufficient dataprotection and those countries
in my opinion the review of the customs information system as reflected by the report is necessary in order to adapt it better to the control services requirements and to allow a limited number of users to carry out analiysese of the information contained in the system
the review will also increase the effectiveness of the cooperation and control prosedurs of the customs administrations do to the joint outomatat information system that will assist ind preventing investigating and prosecuting serious contreventions of national laws
sometimes i had the feeling that alittle to much of this inovative energy we in the ` greeing group ] believe that the report is an important one the aim of it is a very legitimate and crucial one for the time
has it been about onleaching the full potential of the & lismen treaty ] in the field of security and defence we would be in full support
it would be an agency without transparency parliamentary oversight let alone control we are in full support ofe centralisation it makes sense in this field but not in this way without any accountability what soever
~ secondly ] we believe that before committing large amounts of fresh money to defencin h security we should explore a full potential effic of efficiency agains through cooperation and only after this shal we consider additional funding that might be available through the % european union ] budget or from member states
these are the main reasons why our group is unable to support the report even though we are committed to a stronger ) european ] common defence ind security policy and there are many very good ideas in the report in general
an aggressive fiscal plening
they have the potential to nable us to solve many of ther critical problems confronting urs
in order for it to be effective briging thedigital divide has to be mainstrem into every other police area with accordance with the ` united nations ] systainable development gals
digedal technowlodgies has a huge potentialst in terms of reducing poverty increasing the competitiveness of economic and creating employe opportunities
private sector needs to get involved and play a rule through its experties and innovation know how
at the same time huge increase in mobal services is sucuring across the planet and the numbers of mobal users are now surpassing the numbers of people having access to electricity silutation or clean water
in the ) european ] consenses on development which is a crucial document on development policy of the % eu ] and its member states we can find the bold statement that they will continue to support information and communication technologies and developming countries are powerful anaires of inclusive growth and systainable development
we are all aware of the fact that also in this area of development cooperation public funding will not be sufficient for a truly transformative digitalisation process
according to & th wo thousand and sixteen ] ward development report on digital dividencs!! six billion ] people lack access to high speet internet and! four billion ] still have no internet access at all
in order to realise these goalls both developing countries and develop countries as well as all actors both public and private need to maximise and join their efforts
special attentions attention has been given to supporting digitalitrasy and skills to empouer people especially women and people in vurnulable and marginalised situations to promote social inclusion and to facilitate the participation in democratic governance and the digital economy
whereasstigitalisation is rapidly growing globaly our partners from developing countries continue to lag behind losing the opportunity to fully utalise the human capital towards the achievement of the ) ssystanal ] development gols
at a time when # jutarlisation ] is growing fast this lak of access is a major challenged to development asit continues to widen gups and inequalities in the war
if this potential is to be realised then we must find ways of tarning these technologies into resource for all people despite the challenges they face within the % u ] communities what does tit mean
for this very reason there is a need for public prival cooperation based on development principles
tit does not work and i very muc hope that we can take away the last exemptions for airports and harbers and so on for using these inefficient methods that create people feeling bad
so i think this report is important
d how can you say that you will have a high level of protection when people forget cethese on cafes for! twenty million ] people's data on them nd whwh we know that how easy it is to hack into computors i myself as a kid actually
tethen you look at the anti terror legislation with profiling and you see it creates in security and it creates problems for people to live their dayly lives and it cannot combat terrorism with anti terror laws that create the same insecurity feelings
we can see it is neither efficient nor legal
the ) german ] survilance scheme on @ eighteen o fortee year old ] } muslem menin ] % germany ] was not efficient
` thte council ] need to adapte logic and spend the resources efficiently targeting the specific individual and focus ta time on them and instead of going for ethnic registration which is i complete violation with any human rights standards
this matter is extremely important because from * europe ] we can make sure that the latest technology impacts on the usefulness the efficiency of road transport in all its forms
we need more data on the wind screames so that we can sourt out our own solvations in a more effective and efficient manner
so often as elected members we gourny round our constituencies and find ourselves in trafficke jabs and so often we have to make % fomecoaus ] to find out what the situation is ahead
i wish ms } jenson ] and the commissioner every success
madam president i speak as a civil engonere and my % sune ] has a transport surveling business
o i o the % chines ]
@ seit ]
this is the key point where we talk about cohesion
this is exactly the moment when the government should step in and some of them do it but some of them do not
apart from that it does not make sense to repeat ) rong thingsu ] it does not make them more true
we are definitely not financing military operations out of our budget in future
ightly so it remains with the national budgets and with the national governments and parliaments but we have to become more efficient
this exercise is primarily also and more efficiency exercise because if we plan together if we procure together if we train together that makes us more efficient the tasks ahead
wel in % natu ] whe could block everything if we had to ` lyo ] rely on ` nato ] any veto from any member state would definitely block our access totonata resources
we need a certain amount of strategic and operational atonomy as % eu ] in order to be able to do what we dem appropriate
finally sanctions are part of the efficient % eu ] policies i propose that we should make these more efficient tarketing concrete individuals responsible for breaking international laws and humanght violations
protection procedures are simplified
i would like to ask the commission and the ) gre ] government to continue the implementation of the approved legislation full implementationon % eu ] law will generate convergenes in the quality of ` rek ] institutional framework with the best ) european ] countries
the late paydment's regulation is a case where the ) grek ] economy would have big dibirenced to avoid future generation of non performing loames when the next crisis come
it would also be good to understand how } rebenus ] from & incontaxt ] have been lower in @ two thousand and seventeen ] than in! two ] % thousanand ] and! sixteen ] even though the economy of the country is growing
during the crisis under the threat and during the very limited time new framework including the fiscal compact that we are debating @ today ] was created
pending money that people do not have is not good policy
asthe consequence country soon after suffer with substantial difficulties and people have suffered
just looking at the data would observe that in the * eurozone ] @ from two thousand and nine ] every year there was decline of the fici gdp
~ second ] what is the state of play on the member state competent authorities
the roming like at home rule was! one ] of the most significant success stories of the % eu ] @ this year ]
now we have to take it! one ] step further by expanding it to the * vestment balkan ] candidate states already during the accession negotiation
this would be beneficial to the economies t through market integration and better services
these include sextual explotations of ) syrian ] refugees by those delivering aid on behalf of the ` united nations ] and other well known international organisations
several countries countries including the % united kingdom ] and the % netherlands ] have announced investigations into the funding they provideo these and other international organisations and that they intend to make measures to prevent similar situations in the future
through its external financial instruments and te european development fund the % eu ] provides ( billions ] of es in assistance to ~ third ] countries through international organisations among other chalels
i therefore have a few questions for the high representative on a response from the % european union ]
~ first ] of all will will the commission on the high representative } ordera thorro ] investigation to determine whether % eu ] funds have financed * ether ] directly or indirectly the organisations where sexual abuse has been established
~ secondly ] what is the response by the commission and the high representative to the abuse cases that have recently come to light
in order to combat and prevent sextual nis conduct within international aid organisations it is te room for guidelines within the % eu ]'s external financial instruments that would make funding strictly conditional on respect for principles oversihte guidelines accountability and regular reporting from benefisioars on this issue
~ thirdu ] not te least will the commission and the high representative consider working with member states such as the % united kingdom ] and the % netherlands ] to set up contact points in ~ third ] countries including in crisis sonse for victims victims of abuse
the showed that with a more ambitious proposal the! fewwis ] saving cost would be much bigger than the cost of a new vecle the relative cost of the increase of the new vecls
i am prepaired to pay more taxes but i o have to be fair and they have to be good taxes
we had control on controls and! tunch five ] times
the aim is to perform better to show it simpler rules as the commissioner said to combin funds and this s i think the need fom beyond
so this is the aim
to t ol i think we made big steps forward
this is why to complement ` gedyp ] the commission is investigating other indicators including demographic change
inclusion in any forms breats resentments confruntation extremist and sometimes violence integration on the other hand is a promise of stability and ce not to mention the economic contributions at migrants usually young people can bring to an agent population
the ) mor ] moral leadership of * europe ] is important but also an example by showing that grin business is very important for our competitiveness
in order to have such a global agreement in order to persade other countries come forward we have to keep pressing by our examplean example which has its moral importance
this is why it is important to keep in mind that the international community will have to share those cost
the report is right in saying that without a contribution of developing countries our global efforts will faile
when discussing the future actions aim at keeping the rising loval laverage temprature below todegrees above reindustrial levels we cannot ignore the fact that the least develop countries are not able to cover the coust of necessary investments in % cluna ] technologies
everybody knows that there are some pressing the ) european ] issues like # braxcetagration ] election in some member states but we have to take the expectations of our partners in the vestment bulcans more seriously otherwise we might lose them
our common vision for the future of the % eu ] has to build on our most charrished asset which is our unity
if the & rom ] declaration to be on the occasion of the @ sixtyt ] anniversery of our the % european union ] will be about the vision of the multi speed * europe ] then it will become not less than the deth sertificat of the ) european ] project
a vision for the future must not formalise the present dey frusterations
the eit rules that were agreed @ seven years ago ] a having on micro enterprises have taken advantage of the internet to set up small businesses
and! one ] of % yhus ] spokesmen sent you a tweet blaiming the member states
so do you think that is the right atitude for the commission to take or is it in conflict with their clear aim to create ta digital single market
i really want to say that day have @ today ] the situation in % turkey ] is reminding me and other people of my age whoch have lived in ) socialist ] system the days an the beginning of starl in terror but i suppose that now we are able to learn from history and to stopp this development in % turke ]
they are looking atus
of course i do understand the hardships for many ) europeans ] in this crisis
te welfare systems is painful but it is necessary to ensure stability and future growth
t politicians should have acted muc early in preventing the crisis they failed to react in time
blaming % brussels ] is sadly to say a rather common way for national politicians and some others to escape their own responsibilities
politics is about responsibility and accountability
you can see improvements now
what i am saying is that the main responsibili what happen in * europe ] is in the capitals of * europe ]
i agree with you that the defende spending is of course awful and the relations ship with some of the neghbours
ifyou lok at the great challenges of * europe ] its migration and security its solidarity or the lack of solidarity and growining in equalitie
but having said that our group is also disappointe ecause we especially here in ` parliament ] all of us are elected to prepare the future of * europe ] and that means getting into the concerns of * europe ] and you know very well what they are
soyou do not need all this & senarias ]
t th social piller and of course climate change
how do we move forward
every single member every single committee and every single body of this house must be imbolved
that is what i thank the commission to have presented! five ] differentecenareas even knowing that non of them will be fully accepted
i cannot understand it
we may have forgotten to explain that there is not alternative to the % union ] not in the past not ow an not in the future
i agree with } persionan juncker ] that the time has come to alline espectation with reality
we may have forgotten where we come from
* europe ] belongs to all of us
we come from ware death poverty and hunger we come from lack of freedom we may have forgotten ` whay ] unity is so important
to conclude this debate is necessary a debate about future that we want for ourselves and for our children
what member states must do is to stop blaming * europe ] for what * europe ] cannot do because it does not have the tools
the question is simple how do we want to deal with those challenges
% ut lso ] do we want to move forward this is a legitimate ) stian ] because i know that i want to move forward but we cannot just blaim those who do not want to go further than we are now by colling them unt ) europeans ] we all are ) europeans ] * europe ] belong to all ) europeans ] no matter if they come from the north or the south
they have to be confrunted with their own responsibilities and i think that this is a very important step to bring transparency and democracy and eligetimacy to this process of reforming % theuropean union ] in the next future finally i would like to say
that the ` epp group ] has approved its own strategy
reshaping amicrocratic framework can help us reinforce and rebuild our economies from the community opwards
economic crisis has forsed us to take a long hard look at our past an economic behaviour
i sincerely hope that following on from this exlent report we see significant and coordinated action at community level to support the invaluable work that has been done and by and for ` migro ] enterprise at local and national level around the % european union ] as it is a very important part of our economy today and a very important part of our economy into the future
addressing an improving access to microcredit offers us the opportunity to address these past mistakes
that in ` tern ] i think offers us aan opportunity to learn from our past mistakes
onward going to the future i can see that sity continuin to expand on the basis of thes well allecated wellcontroled funds i would call for more involvement of the private sector in the way that the funds are allecated and managed and control because i think the private sector can always do a more efficient job than the public sector
i would also like to emphasise how very invaluable these mones have been to the roral areas of the * north west ] % wherther ] * ias ] a lot of agricultural areas which are vital to the hole economy
this is a very interesting development and essential at this time in the economic situation
there must also be used to bring in private finance ~ thirdly ] because a different approaches from different member states we would like to have a look whether iti feasable to have an % eu ] framework for non bank mico finance institutions
we have to ensure that our legislation is proportional to the problems we are dealing with and particularlyn the ipps that we have talked about @ today ]
iti could by itself be the biggest helpful businesses in the % european union ]
ahead of voting on the legislation on ovl food we should recall the reasons for having been prodent and the aware of risks for health and wellfare of animals
we know from our past experience with the similar issues that tackle both food safety and adicat relations between humans as dominant species and the nature that public perception depends very much on the specific nowledge of the matter
consumers are increasingly sensitive about suffering and angeries of farm animals and therefore they have right to be informed about the potential of cloning to calse pain and to waste natural resources
the add th development of animal clonin as a metod of food production is bein pursued without public awareness
the problem ` wtclonin ] do not concern just wealfare our annimals but also consumer confidence in food since it is believed that in * europe ] food is produced to a very high standard
the ) euro barromitor ] study from @ last october ] documented serious public concerns in regard of hapotlitical future use of food products from clons this is linked to the sale of important food which could be eventally solved in * europe ] without being labouled as product from clont animals
i therefore agree with rapporters approach urging the commission to come up with a separate piece of legislation on clos
among other problems which have been covered by the amendments tabled by my political group i wish particulararly support the sharing of information from animal esting so to avoid the need for new tests involving animals
t visiable understandable not only among ourselves but also more and more outside
this all creates a nightmare for the budget negotiations
it is ongoingntendency to cut as much as possible without any rational and at the same time taking new obligations new commitments
we have ` unes ] situation to solve the problem with no expenses for the member state
the reply from the ` councilis ] whether the ` council ] and the member states prefer to take this money wot their own pocckets and gnore the commitments theya made in the past and ignore the payments they have to make or they want really address the problem show the ) european ] wil ] and pay the bils
the decision on all the whole set of amending budgets could be made very easily
@ een days ] and days trying to figur out whether the ` council ] is going to respect its commitments or not
create additional tentions in the budget of @ two thousand and eight ]
we have to give it back to the member states
so it is clear that we will continue to have great partners within the ` united ] stats even if the ) fethera ] government deciders to sta on theside of the road
finally my last remarto this house is that the ` wals ] reaction to perciden tramp action proved that the % european union ] is on the rightside of history
united
as we hav heard a lot of political leaders in * europe ] say that we would keep up the engagements in the & paris agreement ]
is our go
we have to ad now but ave been partually reopen
it is positive that the % eu ] delegation in % gneva ] will give a strong priority to defend the universality of human rights against efforts from several countries to undermind this concept
more than ever it is crucial that the % eu ] supports the ` un human rights council ] financially and politically to ensure that it can continue to work independently
however i deeply regret that the ` council ] did not include a reference to the & un ] & binding treaty on business and human rights ] which is the single most important normative process currently on going
that the % eu ] has not been constructive in the process and hope that the % eu ] will listen to the requests by the ` european parliament ] and give its full and unconditional support to the un binding treaty process
mr president the mults prime minister mr } muskat ] has predicted that the number of people crossinto * europe ] will reach record level
most of these people will come from % libya ] into % italy ] ) vio ] people traffickers as we know
the best way to stop these huge numbers of people illegally coming into * europe ] and to stop large numbers of tragic deths in the * mediterranean ] is shurely to turn the boats back and process the migrants off % shor ]
that is why! six ] ) european ] countries now have been in private talks with ` austrailia ] asking them which way to work things out because they know that the % eu ] % w ] is failing
only @ today ] we have been warned by the ) itallian ] officials that % gardis ] are actually plugging the gaps in funding for their actual campain by smuggling people into * europe ] because their ) oyl ] money is running out
o forward
we have been taking the account most if not all of concerns what have been rised by analising the previous trade deals with other countries and i think that we can vs great confidence say that this trade deal is in many ways a golden standard for future trade deals in the world
it is not ment to tsers andthis is what i would like to say to those who are not listening the facts but following the alternative news an not trying to go into the deps of the annalysis of the trade deal please do not bark at the $ rong tree ]
thank you } tou caneda ] for this
w % ye wil ] de deliver trade in goods and dencrease terrers
sendings ar solgier since the # first volt war ] to defend our freedoms and our liberties
& seta ] is like a light house for these guidelines for many who are searching fora welth and trade
so from that perspective i would say that every country just like my small country latr i will benefit out of this
the ~ first ] direction is protectionism proventionalism decline and building of wals
will we take the direction of protectionism and closeness or we will fight for liberal democratic values for growth and for the new golden standards of international trade
it is a younee chance for % european union ] now to take again a leading position in the global economy and global politicas and in many ways the vote for ` seta ] will decide about this never beforee world needed such a strong * europe ] at this moment and it needs a guidelines for good trade
do we really wanti
of course sad that trade deal is not a cure a medicen for each and every decease
world is vuching he % european union ] which direction we will take
we have been dying in the ~ second ] % wold ] war for our freedoms and liberties and also now when the % european union ] are facing security challenges at its external borders ) cannadian ] soldiers again ar on our sandy beaches in northern * europe ]
geograpphic indications a lot of geographic indications for many our producers and of course the investment part
the ~ second ] direction is the openness to the world it is a leadership it is e effective decision making it is a growth and finally also is a bringing of wealth to our % union ] and each in every nation and member state here in % european continent ]
it will deliver additional possibilities for services
t t is a judgment day because @ since two thousand aand sixteen ] we have been discussing in ` european parliament ] more than! eighteen ] times in different large groups what this trade deal really means for us
try to find other solutions for other existing problems but go forward with this deal
please do not % sweich ] out this light vote for ` seta ]
it is comprehensive but it will not solve all the problems but our workers small and medi enterprises and people are facing
is a god thing
tis because most of us believe cta is good for our economy particularly for smes and it does not threaten our choices values or laws
the ` sdi group ] has tainabled its own consentual resolution which clarifies what we mean by progressive trade agreements by spelling out clearly what we like about % cyta ] and what we do not like about % cyta ] and espect to be further corrected in % cyta ] were agreed or in future trade agreements more widely better provisions on sustainable development and a sanctions based approach
& wtn fourteen ] we have voice concerns demanded changes and we have achieved most of those already on the occasion of what was effectively the ~ second ] conclusion of the negotiation in @ febrary ]
the ` sndy group ] has decided to vote in favourt of ` ceta ]
improved transparency for all trade agreements int future
but it is also an act of trust and an offera partnership towards the % eu ] institutions not to be the commission and the councils with } whih ] we want to work together for a better trade policy and towards % canada ] which is the country that shares our values our objectives and our hopt for a better future
we welcome as a group of the fact that many of the citizens concerns have been addressed through the clarifications and commitments from the commission and the ) carnadian ] authorities through the jointinteputitive instrument and the other instruments in the package & ceta ] is not perfict far from it but it is an important step in the right direction a more progressive trade policy wher the benefits are will spread among all citizens
! twenty four million ]upeans are unemployed! twelve million ] ) uropeans ] are long term unemployed and! five million ] unemployed ) europeans ] are under the! eight ] of
we the representatives of the people of * europe ] need to rethink labour market policies
if we want * europe ] and ) europeans ] to prosper in @ th twenty first century ] we must create a competitive ) european ] labour market and part of this is exactly to avoid the * midmet ]
too many and! twoo ] strong protectionist measures have blocked initiative flexibility opportunities
this mismet is unfortunate for many ) europeans ] whom are out of work
it is unfortunate for our societies whic miss out wealth and prosperity
we need to promote flexibility
it is unfortunate for the businesses which cannot fill their vacances
in! two ] many places in * europe ] the labour market is riged even static
this mismes on the ) european ] labour market causes an uncompetitive ) european ] labour market
explosives and poisons
the fact is other than a small reduction over our ful usage there is no environmental benefit
@ in recent weeks ] we have seen a lot of properganda outline in the suppot environmental tridentials of elector pols fishing but the fact is littale independent nonpartege and science has been completed
we all wanted more in real but it is not true that nothing has been osaved
mr } hopenstat ] this will be my last speech before this chamber after tred to @ years ]
of them it is quite clear that some key % eu ] policies will be undermind without proper financing and therefore we are happy to support the proposal
~ secondly ] we should also ensure that these organisations do not in any way become agencies because if they did they would be subject of course to the & inter institutional agreement on agencies ]
the ` budget committee ] recognises the importance of these proposals and the urgency

r i agree with m & tga ] this is really high time that we discuss this issue in the planary session and i thank you all colleagues and all members who brought this question it is extremely important for the consumers and for he well functioning digital single market to have a newteral independent access to search systems of ai transport services
transparency and newtrality of the search of flights increased competition and made truble withn the % eu ] affordable for many ) europeans ]
we will continuet discussion on this subject in our working group on digital single market which % iahare ] and precisely during our next meeting it will be on @ e twenty second of november ] and you are all invited to join us but let us not forget that this is not the only problem that consumers encounter when boooking the flights
they are often goblocked and have to pay a higher price because of they ar place of residence or to put it more precisely because of the temporary location based on thei rip address
the consumers cannot be discriminated online and they are choise of best offers cannot be restricted by business models
remind ed us of this possibility

let me breafly explain to you what this is about
t t a lot of potential some people even } likn ] it to the kind of revolution that was sparked by the introductionof the internet and i have to say although not a all ) myfelo ] shadow rapporttes are here we had a very exciting very interesting anda frankly very enjoyable time
its virtual currencys and distributed leger technology so one would be forgiven by thinking whel this is a doul and somniferous subject that perhaps will gently put us into sleep t this hour later our of the day
what we advicate in the report is not to styful innovation by regulating now but instead to closely moniter what is going on by the creation of a task force } wil reacha ] suggestion be created at the level of the commission n then to regulate
some of you may have wondered why is it so much cheeper to send an emal orn sm s than to transfer funds for example from somebody working in! one ] country and sending remitnses back home because in the end the transfer fund is not much more than electrotronnic message even @ today ] but still it can be rather expensive! seven ] to! eight ] of the funds transferd
te interesting area for government applications fighting ve tey fraud orusing it to implementa innovative lan land register of course with such a new technology its @ early days ]
of course this technology could help us to reduce these transaction cost significantly in the long run and i think if we regulate well we might even havea open access electronic wollets where the transfer funds would be decided by some sort of la cost trouting
we are not at the stage wh the risk that come with any such technology are systemic
but f course one would be rong because this new technology has a lot of promise
fundamentally what this is about this distribute leger technology that underlis the bitcoin an the most prominent vertual currency is a decentralised data base that keeps a record of any sort of trans action done within that datbase in a way that is surprisingly safe resilient and trust worthy
this technology can be used indeed as the title of the initiative report would suggest for vertual currencies and in order to reduce the cost of financial transaction significantlys
t es t for clearing at settlement autimatic contracts for example implementing terevatives on the distributo leger far beyond the financial sector
i have lodged my papers with the ` courto first ] instance so i intend to fight a very robused case
all i would like to say is that the big fustem bother about my parliamentary assystemes expenses and covered by the media over @ the last nine or twelve months ] it has been a harrowing experience
i understand i have a very good case and also along with that i have gon for interim measures which means that no money will be paable untill the court has heard all the evidence and made the appropriate decision

eover we have also succeeded in future proof in the legislation by introducing provisions on sobardidates and smort appliances and explicitly banding the use of defeet devices finally the labour will be able to sho information about for exampl durability of repatability thereby further helping consumers to save money and at the same time contributing to the objectives of the circuler economy

some people are claiming that the ) german ] application of the & minimom waytes ] is! one ] of the most serious attacks on the single market since the adoption of the & single market act ] these protections measures create barriers all the way down * europe ]
this is very serious and very woryn

it was initially expected that ` ema ]'s registered companies would have preformed better since the mas environmental requirements are % tougr ] as compared with older and better known sertificates such as i
among them is & aline ] in the definition of & imas ] which i saw particularly important
n the problem is how modern technologies can be used for environmental protection and how industry all services should be helped in promoting the invinonmental value of the protection
existing voluntary and regulatory instruments were not linked to each other in order to establish sinerges
mr ) european ] legislation was set to encourage enterprises to improve their products and attain higher standards of energy efficiency and environmental compliance
from past experience we know that sertificas on various levels were not sufficiently coordinated
equalabollin as a part of % eu ] action plan on sustainable production consumption and industrial policy is such a tool
~ first ] revision of the emas scheme was not encouraging
the gol of ecological sertificates is to engage sinarges with other legal acts that are tackling in vinonmental aspects of the products
it is about striking the balance between regulatory and market based instruments with the aim of developing voluntary standards for various products and services or helping to optimise production processes and make more effective viuwse of resources
it would help organisation to proceed more easily from % iso ] to & imastandards ]
forteen } } hosan ] and! one ] yet ` ema ]'s registerd companies were not performing better and the system of invinonmental excellencey was # weeker ] as compared with ` iso ]
impartial system of certification will be wih suppose appreciated also by consumers i hope that this will help organisation to cuse the most rational systemic approach in order to inteconnect different fields of the invironmental protection

if we do not speak up when fundamental democratic principles r or manipulated then we also send another type of message we tell those studients that democracy is important for us and we are luckly that we can benefit from it inside the % european union ] but we do not really care if other people lead in a democrat democratic society r not
mrspker there are many reports from various sources coming in on the current situation in % hongcon ] but there is clear that the authorities are trying to menipulate and limit in some cases even violently the democratic process
when studiens peacefully protest for the democratic and indeed human rights anywhere in the world they deserved to be backed up by us in the % european union ] as a global power of democracy
if we in this house ar silence we approve of the message from the government of % china ] and that is why we have to protest and make sure that the demonstrators actually are seen and that we do not forget their deeds

it is going to give the impression that is in the driving seet to solve the problem
o we have a ) european ] economic recovery plan of which the cor industry is a part
in reality each manufacture is going to look after itself as best it can and each country will look after its manufacturors as best it can
there is of course a possible case for some support some financial support to the corren industry and other sectors to keep capital intact and to keep skills intact
this can only be decided e national level because the support appart from the ` european investment bank ] mentioned by mr } bohogan ] that support can only be provided by national taxpayers but there is! one ] thing that the % european union ] can constructively do here at least untill the recessions over tats give

in order to address concerns expressed by parliaments the extention of the ` atonomos ] trade preferences is subject to } akraine ]'s respect for the essential elements of the association agreements
the unileteral markets access ganted to ) akraine ] coresponse to the ~ first ] sero of application of the scagul of consesessions negotiated under theditecf
economic political security and teritorial challenges i would like to thank ` parliament ] } mischr ] for the efforts already made to pave the way for a swift conclusion of the legislative procedure for this file in order to ensure that trade flows are not disapted
in addition safe guard controls are in place to prevent market distorting seargers impacting adversitly on ) european ] companies and industry including the agricultural sector
as part of the @ september ] twelvh outcome the commission also agreed to submit a proposal to extend until @ the end of two thousand and fifteen ] the atonomous trade preferences currently granted to % ekrain ] as they will otherwise seease to applys of
expressed satisfaction when the association agreement was ratified
the proposal by the commission for such delay was based on a clear request from } mukraine ] to take an initiative that would allow he gratification of the association agreement to go ahead while leaving more time to discuss ways of addressing rassiona concerns arising from the implementation of the & gdct ]
this outcome must be seen in the bigger political context
the current proposal simply extends the guration of those atonomous preferences by! fifteen ] additional mans % thu ] maintaining the same preferences
most importantly from an economic point of view the itonomous trade prefrences have a very limited impact on the % eu ] markets and yet at the same time they will present a gesture of tangiable economic and political support to % akraine ] in a difficult situation helping to address ) krains ] difficult
% eu ] fiter cenitory rules remain fully applicable to ) ukranean ] products
let me recall the basic elements of these itonomous trade preferences
we must stend sholderd sholder with % ukraine ] in face of the extremely difficult political and territorial challenges it faces but also in its process of reforms and economic modernisation
delays in the extention of trade preferences should indeed be avoided and this could have an impact on economic operator's decision to import goods fom % ukraine ]
even retoractive application risks not fully reparing interferences with trade flows and would be cambacum not only for the economic operators but also our competent national customs authorities
} erainlyar ] not neutral when it comes to women
the bottomline has been seaid here over an over there has to be some steping up over the work there has to be some binding measures
i hope and expect the commission to take this on board because it also means a lot who we are as a player on the global level

my understanding } waas ] during the } martes ] presidency during the @ lastacouple of months ] there was an important shift of paradime in the whole migration and refuge issue a shift from just! alein ]! millions an millions ] of migrants coming to * europe ]
towards treating the root causes and treating the whole issue locally
tis the policy of the % european union ] following the ) martes ] presidency this kind of paradimeshift is what my country hungry has been fighting for for a long time and we shall never give up
the benefits of globalisation do indeed have to reach all citizens and all communities
i strongly believe that the % eu ] can make a difference in the essential fields of labour rights and anlonmental protection among others and alsotlot its test chapters in our fts
in conclusion to all that } worllkican ] share the ` epp group ]'s view that we see sanctions as a last resolt mechanism and would appreciate turning towards more effective ways to deal with the problem at hand
the experience gathered so far at a global level shows that trade related sanctions full short of deliveringthe desired results
we do not see conclusive evidence that sanctions could lead to an improvement of the effectiveness and t implementation of tsde chapters
the way fortward is to consolidate these chapters and to strive for the more effective and sustainable implementation of this important pillerd in our value based trade policy
ther being said to address any dout that may arise during this debate mf is not an unconditional support
i believe that our common gole is to help % ukraine ] but it is true that we need to closely follow the situation
t e wo to be dispersed as medium and long term bloans the assistance is also intended to triger reforms in % ukraine ] which is done by agreeing with the ) ukrainean ] authorities a memorandom of understanding
this means that the rapporteur does not support any amendment & stabletaplenary ] and e recommends to close thefile } intefirst ] ready to end i would like to underline once again this report is just a legal base what the ` european commission ] to disperse the money
~ third ] to reform process which has been important but is not really steaded until now
therefore it is crucial that a! two ] unfulfild ) anty ] corruption measures will be pout of the new conditions
a step into the right direction is the adoption of the law on high andte corruption court is @ last week ]
in that context i would like to highlighte! three ] key elements
if corruption is not addresseddresicdressigly and mifai fund should not be delivered to % ukraine ]
in addition to newly adopted law who asigned @ yesterday ] by the president of % ukraine ] i welcome rapporteur welcomes this news with great satisfaction it means that ) eukraneians ] stake the commitment seriously
~ first ] to personing conflict and casualities in the * easteof ] % ukrain ] and to halter } evry socia ] economic consequences of this egration ~ second ] the economic recovery which remained fragel
hence twe need for support to these reforms inte context where many interest can play against especially in a @ pre election years ]
but they will do so only when ) ukraneans ] manage to filfill ) altiagreed and outstanding conditions
they are firm conditions to ensure that this money willselve to the economic stabilisation and t the support of the reforms no it is very important to remind that the commission ` council ] the last tranch of the ttmfa programme when some % ukraine ]'s commitments were not fulfilld
in other words it is a financial instrument and its purpose is economic stabilisation this is the firt t fort time that the commission proposes an mf tor % ukraine ] since the beginning of towar in @ two thousand and fourteen ] this time the commission proposes! one billion ]
if we are serious about our * gol ] we cannot slow down to procedures
this memorrandom sets out to supporting policy measures which are conditional for the dispersements of the funds
i am very grateful that we are where we are now indeed % ukraine ] needs this * seport ] and it deserves this eport and i think it is very appropriate to have this next programme now
rateful to the commissioner that you although it is not included in the joint declaration you explicitly refer to that because thatit is what it is also about
we need to be very clear in this regard
however the iturnally crucial lestue remains that of the implementation
we recommend taking advantage of ) litianian ] presidency in the ` sen partnership's summit in ` vns ] as an opportunity to improve relations } witbelaras ] of course as soon as all political prisoners have been released and to restart the political dialogue on inter alia democratic reforms free and fair elections and respect for human rights
however forvote is probably the ~ first ] time we discuss & ballaras ] and its relations with the % eu ] not by reacting to the frequent negative news from this country but rather by trying to analise the situation and thus propose concrete policy actions i would like to thank! twenty five ] colleagues
therefore we urge ` bellaus ] to lift any obstacles and restrictions to exercise ou freedoms of association expression movement peaceful assembly thoughts for democratic opposition and their ng os
it is very important instrument and should be used for strengthening people's understanding for need for reforms and for the development also of an appropriate social net
i believe that all these and other artificial barriers should be broken down as soon as possible
we recommend encouraging the ) bie ] civil society including trade unions and business representatives as well as the political opposition alongside ) whith ] officials to increase their involvement in the dialogue on modernisation
some influential ) european ] politicians belief that % belras ] is losst for the % eu ]
we suggest that it would be done in a very tharful way in order to improve their affic effectivenesss and adopt their scope nature and validity reacting to their developments in the country
doy really need to beild a democracy in % theuropean union ] to have a top down likd selected and coopted by ) european ] parties or what is really very very darangous for ) european ] movements of national parties
if we are not a % federation ] why should we have a joint constituency ta not even the fedterations hav
they must take ~ second ] place play ~ second ] fidel to the needs of our ports and our boat
it is obvious for everyone that the current system is unfair and has a devastating effect on honest taxpayers including small and mediumsised t enterprises therefore i cannot see any reason why not to act in order to change this situation

dear colleagues dr representative i am looking on these issues especially as a spokes person for security in ` defencse ] from the ` epp group ] and in this specific policy area it is so obvious that the % us ] is and will remain an indispensible partner

he has made no effort at all to speak with the ` efdd ] as a group
in ` ereomisar ] our group is clearly committed to transparency and accountability especially in the use of public fund
a party represented by! one ] ` mp ] still needs to be represented in at least a quorter of the member states in order to be resisted
weny to ake sure we make it more open and incrusive less for modern regets
this is very good news as an important element of the strategys success is to ensure everybody is on bord
this is why we propose enhancing the coordination at all levels through thestablishment of an % european union ] th coordinator in the designe of national action plans
citizens cannot go on being desolusiond one summit after another
services and proficional qualifications directives consumer address and esmisencentoves
lack of proper transposition and information potential of the digital market
otherwise for the citizen unles there is this realisation this will become nothing more than a meaning less tired busword
this resolution is a call for economic growth but in my opiion it is also an indication of de frustration which ` parliament ] and perhaps also the commission is experiencing with a red effective completion of the single market
we are alread feeling unfortunately the effects of protectionism in various ways
howeverad most importantly it must be a market which is credible well understood and trusted by citizens providing ) heuropeans ] whith are ealistic and holistic action growth plan in order to achieve a truly competitive inclusive and social economy
time is running short and the continued unity and integration of the market are being seriously threateined
the relaunch of the economy and the single market will need the continued impetus and impat and hopefully the leadership of the commission and the committed ownership by the member states
once again we are discussing the potential of the single market but the citizen is tared of this & retoric ] and instead wants to see the realisation of this potential because the single market is very vital for a % european union ]
it would be deeply saidat the @ fift year ] of this legislature we were to find our serve sharning out yet another resolution on the single market and debating the same problems that were identified in the @ first year ] amongst others the fragmentation and inatequate application of rules
it this high time the ` council ] came up with more coordinated urgent specific solutions and dacision to the crisis created after all by the responsible behaviour of some banks this ` parliament ] and the commission especialthe commission } barnie ] have been making specific proposal and initiatives yet we seem to move very slowly
we had an ambitious and thoughtful ` parliament ]
and for the ~ first ] time we had an ambitious proposal by the commission
the late paydment's regulation is a case where the ) grek ] economy would have big dibirenced to avoid future generation of non performing loames when the next crisis come

what can be done to ensure that the revision process go smothly and is finalised before @ first of may two thousand and fifteen ] as specified in & articale n nineteen of & mut annua ] financial framework regulation so as to avoid losing uncommitted amounts from
but the programming stage is still far from being finalised
what is the commission's current position regarding the treatment of commitments for operational programmes c cofinanced by the european regional development fund the european social fund the european agricultural fund for the rral development the european marritime and fisheris fund and the cohesion fund which will not be adopted by the end of
moreover for programmes not ready for adoptioned by @ thirty first december two thousand and fourteen ] the @ two thousand and fourteen ] commitments can only be preserved by rebudgeting uncommitted @ month from two thousand and fourteen ] in accordance with & articl nineteen ] of the mutiannual financial framework regulation
as a direct consequence there will be significant delay in the concrete start up of the project implementation
only a limited number of operational programmes have been adopted and according to the latest information available only a lettle bit more than! hundred ] programmes will be actually adopted by @ the end of this year ]
however this implyes a revision of the mutiannual financial framework on the basis of a commission proposal with the ` council ]'s agreement and ` parliament ]'s concent
what were the main problems encountered and by ) wich ] member states
however @ two thousand an fourteen ] should not be a lost hear as regards investments from the! five ] ) european ] structural and investment funds in this context i would like to table the following question

reinforce the legal framework for the protection of the % union ]'s financial interest archiving significant results
it restors the competition sometimes it helps to finance illegal activities and iffroses are too high it can push up the taxt rates in other categories
i am glad that th important part of the proposal is simplification of the % tex ] compliance especially for small and medium sise businesses
i believe that better collection of teaxes should not be used for increasing of the government revenues

if done properly it is my strong belief these reforms have a high potential systemic impact

t en statement puts a strong emphasis on the fact that the consideration by the ) muldovan ] authorities of the recommendations of the ` vanise commission ] will be part of the regular monitoring of the respect of the effore mentioned precondition
however it does not mean immediate dispersment
we have clarified that conditions & arto ] be attached to the disbursment of each and every of the! three ] enstollments that bench marks should be clear as required by the ` european court of oditors ] and that the assistance should be immediately suspended orseminatid if the conditions are not met
this in order to address the shorterm balance of payment and fiscal vulnerabilities of the ) moldovan ] economy the proposed assistance therefore amounts to! one hundred million ]
these are reforms that will discipline and constrain the exercise of power by the government and any other economico political actor for generations to come
i would like ~ first ] of all to thank the commission for the very clear & stanse ] on the joint statement adopted by the! three ] institutions and the intention stated here publicly beyond doubt to properly enforce it
e fore a country to be competitive it cannot be corrupted does need to address corruption so i believe we ar doing the righthing with the ` vicft ] on the one hand and wit properly addressing and incentivisinga fight against corruption ` modova ] that is inded the right thing to do
i would also encourage the modovern authorities to truly reache out to the opposition and to civil society and engage in this discussion on the if the discussion continues on the transformation of the electoral system but i also encourage the other parties to accept the invitation for dialogue
tta proper democracy requires loyal democrats on allsides
if % yho ] look at the current situation for customers no real safegards exist against flight cancellations or delays
how do passengers really feel when they tok ` arianir ] flight but they do not know whether it will ever take off and the company plaims poore planning of staff holidays it is not only the customers who are affected it is also the ) cru ] members who work on ourly rate and do not get bate when flights get canceled
what are the work of social conditions if they are only being pad forthe ours you are flying with no income security when flights are canceled
is this the model of aviation re wants in * europe ] or elsewhere a new modele of legal slavery
i saw him untellevition
! one ] main weakness however in the commission proposal nd that % ishat ] there was no provision for the selling of tiers that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date d i believe that is a major flor
her car was destroyed but she walked away relatively unheart why because the carshe was driving had the most modern safety features and that enabled her not to be seriously injered
however in the current circumstance of the cardnessree given that cars are not being sold it was quite clear in the discussions we had witthe ` council ] that in fact @ this twelve months ] was probly on realistic and we have to consider the serious environmental consequences of getting rid of tiers
as mr } harber ] and the commission has pointed out simplification is part of this proposal and i think it is very important and } findlin ] i would draw attention to what we have done in terms of i demanding greater emphasis in rod services in reducing noyis
that is the context in which we are discussing this report
that is why i proposed to the committee and the committe accepted and amendment that said these tiers that did not meet these standards after the implementation date should be soled off after @ twelve months ]
i will bring the attention to this house that none of those free are a woman
i think it is very strange that the commission cannot come up with! one ] single women that is conpident o! one ] of this authorityes
it still has the ~ second ] largest military spending in the world it has a technologically advance and innovative defence sector and yet we are still unable to translate this opportunities into a workable and coherent security policy
the technological military and economic logic of a more integrated % eu ] defence policy is inescapable but the problem is exclusively political
the! one ] thing is total different from the otherthen let me tell you something that is very important
the report makes reference and emphasises rightly the security defende and political challenge that % russia ] provides for the % european union ]
we ale disagree with % th ] just witness the political medling in the # braxet process ] or a number of ) european ] general elections so indeed this is not just an issue for the * east ] to consider and this is not an issue for ` nato ]'s eastern flank this is a larger plat that we need to deal with the ~ second ] and ` proba b ] much more important
much as i would like to avoid this we cannot simply support this vile as it stands now
the is an obligation for biolateral individual response between member states
} ry muh ]
i do not think i need to remind my honourable colleagues that that particular article is not a traditionally understood as an obligation for collective response
the present commission
o my @ lasta few seconds ] i would like to call upon my colleagues make sure that we deliver a broad majority for a strong proposal and do not take it part during the vote on & whensdat ]
the % eu ] is the world's largest providor of development and humanitarian assistance and with the adoption of @ agend an thousand and thirtye last september ] in % new york ] we all committed to the implementation of the new sustainable development gols
as the situation in * europe ] has deterriorated dramatically i think that the new sustainable development gols should take a step further and adopt strong objectives to refflect thenormity of the crisis while addressing the root causes of migration the countries of origin
we want to make sure that the funds achieve their purpose to build sustainable economies help services educational facilities create jobs and give a future to people in their own countries
dev development policy is key in achieving more inclusive and peaceful world by uniting global efforts to improve people's lives world wide and eirredicate poverty
in ta situation where we should raise public awareness in * europe ] on the question of the research programme and specifically of ` itis importanct ] for job and growth and my question would be since weare in the midst of the discussions now in the trilogue on that issue what is you
following the # arab spring ] the international shareholders of the % ebad ] decided to increase the & callabal ] capital so the % ebid ] could extend its operation into countries such as ` egipt ] ` initiaymadam ] president } thi dos ] was considered non contrivercial and the ` european council ] did not amendit
this has produced a far stronger text which recognises the responsibility of the representatives of the % eu ] share holding in the bank and re inforces the reasons fore and the direction of our involvement in this institution
about beneficieries and impact of its financial intermediaty operation furthermore as a result of the committe's amendment the governer of the % ebad ] for the % union ] should now report annually to the ` parliament ] on the promotion of the % union ]'s objectives with regard to the % eu ]'s external action policy the eu two thousand and twenty strategy and thenificant increase of the transfer of renewable energy
in the rsolution we also address the case of the leading civil society activist some parts on ` fone ] who disappeared in @ december ]
% tuoansand ] and! twelve ] he was ollegetly adacted by the * poolice ] and we are still not seeing any reaction of the ` lows ] government
in compliance with the opinion from @ august two thousand and seventeen ] of the ` un working group on arbiterarity detention ] we call for the immediate and unconditional release
i welcome the idea of a leade state and which was announced recently
vigual transaction systems are constantly being improved in order to safe time and efford for users but the security is in my opinion a reason to remain vigelent
many people are easily tricked into revealing personal information online and into meking onsecured transactions with ~ third ] parties antities
that is why i think the most important measures that should be taken ou raising us awareness regarding internat transaction seurity
in the midst of this ) european ] deth crisis we always take the decision to fees consume more now and create deat for the future
we have a very intensive @ five months ] behind us but i am really proud to have been a part of this process we achive the lot together this regulation is a good example of what the % european union ] can achive if there is a poliitical will
under the new regulation the management of the external borders of the % european union ] will be the shared responsibility of the member states in the % european union ]
! one ] of the priorities of our group was to ensure that the agency has a bigger role in search and rescue at se
this situation will be improved by the new regulation
% seuaurch ] and rescue operation will be an important compement of ) teuropean ] integrated border management
the agency start with supporting member states in carrying out these operations
i know that theye are those who are not convinced about this new agency
i share some of ther concerns
this crisis has been brought about as we all know by the kind of casno capitalism ) croney ] capitalism nd a financial services sector that has been subjected to no regulation or lite tuch regulation as it is sometimes politely refered to nd the fall out of all of this for workers and families across * europe ] has been nothing short of catal straffic and i ama struckchr in the debate and in the reports that have been producedat the very polighte way in which we are addressing this scandal
the fact is that the % eu ] response to the financial crisis has been slogish has been minimalust
i am } strucok ] at the fact that the ) liberals ] and ) christian democrat groups ] are concerned at overprescription or that protectionism may be introduced through the back dor
the fact is that we do infact require apa protectionism and those that must be protected are workers and the real economy
we found ourselve in an academic debate in a professional debate and in political debate
lear commitments regarding annual assessment of the work done by these! three ] organisation
tpublic money! fourty three million ] will be used for cofinancing of! three ] non profit organisations which deliver public goods the ` international financial reporting standards foundation ] which through the ` international accounting standards board ]
the public interest of `rsidebord ] which over sees international odit etics and education standards for the accounting professions the ` european financial reporting advisory group ] frag the technical advisor of the ` europan commission ]
it is about the quality of financial information in the decision making process
develop international financial reporting standard
the question of independence of the standard issuers and the governence of this organisation
i ` feris foundation ] and ` icb ] will take measure for interest disclosure in order to avoid conflict of intereast
where appropriate proposal for is regulation changes
we have now created insurance schemes and other schemes to deal with the impaired assets
* europe ] has led the way in so many other areas it is now time to lead the way in creating the global institutions that will deal with the global problems we have and provide global solutions
t we must do that
whatever ther views in this ` parliament ] i think people will get a face up to that as well
i believe that whatever the different views expressed in this ` parliament ] there is a will across the peoples of this world to do that and we * europe ] can play a major role in it
to has changed fundamentally and we need institutions that reflect a global economy in the way it operates and deals with the problems we have
we a domestic competition
i tink the ~ second ] thing that we ave gotto realise despite all the different political views in this in this ` parliament ] is that global cooperation not just in banking institutions but global cooperation in other areas in fiscal and monitory policy and for trade have got to be a very important part of how we approach the future
thethere are global problems that need global solutions
more manufacturing is beng done in * asia ] than in * europe ]
other countries have now done that
we found that banks that we % thouht ] were independent were completely intangled with other banks in different countries and we have to deal with that problem
for us to sit apart to be a loop not to cooperate with other countries is a recipy for failure and for an innability to solve a problem that is actually a global banking failure that as spread across the industrial economy
if we do not understand the problem we will not be able to understand the solution we had a power cut right across the banking system right across the world
} firs ] ~ first ] of all that it is important that the world comes together to deal with this crisis
andwhatever the party political lines ha people want to adopt on this this is the truth we have to deal with the problem of global banking restructuring
we capitilised our banks
we have got to do that and i believe that the lesson of this crisis is that we are now in a global economy
like orlike it not the world is changing incredibly fast
t would i ensure or try to ensure that the international monetory fund had the resources that were necessary to deal with the problems of economies that could not at the moment sustain themselves when thre as a fligt of capital
t i tink that comes out from this discussion for me is t to have global solutions to global problems we will also not just need our ) european ] institutions to be strong but our global institutions to be strong
more than a! cillion ] dolers has been spent in recapitilising banks across the world
that will require us to shapehe global institutions and my message to this ` parliament ] is very clear
i has asked whether the ` world bank ] and other international institutions can help countries where there is substantial poverty being created as a result of the crisis
there is trade round the world at a speed that we have never seen before untill this crisis and we have got to deal with that by creating a global trading environment which is free but also fair
this is the test of how we having over @ the last sixty years ] created a * europe ] which has social protection as well as economic progress can help shape a world where we have economic progress environmental care and social justice at the same time
mr president all member of states have very distinct legal courtures
the legal system of the % uk ] is very different to the rest of * continental europe ]
a blanket policy cannot work in this % union ]
it sadensme to see this report is calling on the commission to urge member of states to ensure the strict enforcement of % eu ] rules on the free movement of persons the % eu ] can not force an % eu ] migration policy on countries who are already dealing with very difficult internal problems such as housing and financial commitments
i also note with concern that the emphasis of this report is on bringing soverein nations states back into line
the reports references to ensuring the % eu ] institutions themselves comply with % eu ] law could almost be a bligatry
this is not a porifery matter
this report like the % eu ] institutions themselves has failed to consider who gards the ` gards ]
this was a sign of neutural respect
ongratulations especially to your commissioner for your commitment in your tof tone which led to the ~ first march agreement ] and count the situation
we have been following the developments very anctiously in % brussels ] and in * europe ] and yet the % eu ] has made tremendous efforts to act as a mediate between the parties
@ last december ] only @ two months ] after the positive commission ` prograss ] report we experienced a major political crisis in the % formar uuslafe ] % republic of macedonia ] the opposition was kiked out of the plenary journalist had been express previously voting took place without their presence
let us continue to work hard keeping the country on the ) european ] & trattrac ]
the whole political process was disrupted due to parlamentary blocking @ for many weeks ]
this is very muc deploral but my programm is that this debate is somewhat out of the context of ` urgencie ] because at the same time we know that @ during this year ] in % iran ]! ten ] times more people have been executed
combate and } bafrin ] have decided to have a mordatoriam on executions for the # passt six years ] and this is something encouraging
it is the only way people have to express ther views about uptcoming projects
the commssion proposal is reinforcing tithedirective
furthermore we ask more soa civil participation
i t it tells you all you need to know about the ` uk independence party ]
if you want to get rid of all these problems you mention this is not the right way
it will increase cost and it will be less competitive for ) teuropean ] market and for the semes that you believe that you are protecting
this compromise thanks to the determination and hard work of many of us will bar good frots
i ask for your broad support in the vote @ tomorrow ]
we prove today that the % european union ] can deliver concrete results for the citizens all over * europe ] bringing positive changes in our daly lives but for the full completion of the digital single market we still need many reforms and a lot of work
we need to do our best to break down national cyloms
there is no place for protectionism in our common ) european ] market
the next step we should take is harmonisation of the vte rules we also need to unifi coperight protection rules and open up the services market in the odovisual sector
i hope that the ` council ] will help us in these efforts as for us in ` parliament ] i hope to see this project in the far front of our agenda
already now i am looking forward to the review in @ two years ] which you have just mentioned mr } bise ] president
toad and! seventeen ] this form will enable for the ~ first ] time an exchange of views between all concerned actors such as consumer representative industry at various stages of the supply chain member states authorities and the commission some of you have called on the commission to propose a specific legislation to prohibualquality
the commission intends to provide te results of this mepping for the next sharpa meeting of the highlevel form for a better functioning of the fod supplied chain on @ twenty jun ] in line with the conclusion of the ` european council of ninemerch ]
so far the commission has receved! twenty one ] eplies from the member state
the establishment of a simple effective and transparent avaration mechanism complementing the current shengen evalration is a most welcome initiative
early elections will be a sensible short term compromise in such as dramatic stand of offering both sides tha democratic solution
minister the members of the ` council ] should ant appeal to the principle of subciliarity since we are dealing with ) european ] elections not with the local regional or national elections we grinsif consider that ` parliament ] electorallaw resolution has been very shigh
without showing a tru ambition to update the electoral system according to the new social and political demands for greater participation accountability and equality
we understend the urgency of producing a % ew ] law on the important subject of the ) european ] elections
our electoral rules
as it is the institution taking the final decision on nratification by the % union ] of any international treaty
however the quality of the ` council ] decision depends to a large extent on the quality of the proposal submitted to it
as i have said discussions on the competence is a very difficult and sensitive one
we have had several arounds of discussion in attempt to find a solution
to find! one ] flexibility needs to be shown by everyone and i will repeated by ` everyne ]
a measure that could significantly facilitate unblocking the situation is a legislative proposal by the commission to adopt the % eu ] legal framework to the & markes treaty ] ahead of the ` council ] decision on the conclusion of the & markes treaty ]
what would not be helpful or productive is to suspend our discussion to start lengthly cot procedures
i will conclude by saying that the & markish treaty ] has been included in the agenda of the ` foregnefrs council ] takes place @ monday next week ]
you should not be able to set the agenda or frame our political responses let alone frame our future you should stop putting people against each other and stop lying about migrants and refugees and should stop confuse migrants and terrorists
it is beyond all dignity and sense
smugglers exist because there is a lack of legal pathways
to externalise borders the way we see that some people here want to do is not to save people
w want to open more legal poathways
the problem however is that our current policy seems not to be working
wef together with the negotiation of themff
we must trive to defend it and make every effort to further increase its effectiveness
for example in @ febrary two thousand and seventeen ] we published a staff document to explain our approach
new alliances are necessary including with big consumer countries especially % china ] and it financial institutions
finally the commission raised awareness on the importance of language learning through public events like the # european day of languages ] on @ twenty six september ] and te national lowards of the ) european ] language labour for innovative language learning projects
in highlighting the compliity brought about by language diversity and the fundamental importance of language technologies on the rod to achieving language equality the report provides food for thoughts for developing future actions
t sop @ two years later ] @ three years later ] to see what comes out and the concrution is clear the work fixd work don
good results and even with more capacity to perform in the future
special times special situation needs special measured
in equalities on the rights d of course that gos exactly to those secmens of the ) european ] social fabric which have been the victims of a long protracted discrimination in history of course the % roma ] commit not only but let me say that making up the budget is not only a mater in this house a single ) european ] political group an of course i do favour i do fa
t ting i wanted to tell you is that in the current dispensation of the ) european ] budget there is a ) twenyor ] social inclusion including in the european social fund
eversince the # gt recession ] got started we ) socialists ] have fought all along the way against the resessive austerityn in favour of ) european ] budget in order to fight social exclusion
thank o subsidarity and proportionality seems to be the past and preident } mackron ] if we let him do so wel change the structure and the strategyis and everything of the % european union ]
he wants a united states of europe while we ) european ] people want a * europe ] of nations of independent nations with suverinity
we the majority of * europe ] do not want migration
on the! one ]side there is my country % hungary ] with the % vichegrad ] heir countries representing clearly the majority of ) european ] citizens
the important thing is that they should speak up much more loudly
still if we want to protect * europe ] and our countries and our communities together * hongerly ] the % fichergrat ] countries and the citizen of * europe ] please speak up wherever you can and support % hungary ]
othe time realy has come for the bank to adopt an up to dat responsible taxation policy and that would involve! three ] measures during the exercise of the bank's du diligence particularly for intermediaries which as my colle gb said % fr ] a particular problem
t tat point which motivates many of the requests that have been made of the bank
all of our interests for example that the fiscal capacity of member states is preserved and that the % eu ]'s aid policy is not undermined by tax lioking away from developing countries
~ first ] we need the bank to make use of the measures contained within the & anti money landering directive ] and particularly to access the new registers of beneficial ownership of companies
the bank did in @ two thousand and nine ] become a pianere when it adopted a policy against non cooperative juristictions but as we all know that policy has lost many of its teeth as those juristictions have creatively complied with the letter of ` oecd ] requirements rather than complying with their spirits
this makes them an indispensible sector in astabilising the ) european ] economy in creating jobs and growth in * europe ]
unfortunately the current instruments are insufficient and do not provide smes especially micro and small enterprises with the necessary means to finance investments
for as long as i have been a member of the ` opean parliament ] i have repeatedly calaled on the member states and the commission to join their efforts and tackled the root causes of migration which is the only way forward to provide a genuine response to the migration crisis in the % eu ] and in * africa ] the fund launched at the # valetta summits on migration ] was designed to help foster stability in the ) african ] regions and contribute to btter migration management
most importantly the fund will healp address the root causes of irregular migration by stimulating investments bosting sustainable growth and job creation in ) african ] countries where most migrants come from
we have to ensure accountability transparency and proper management of funds
we have to ensure well pland investments so that the proposed ( billions ] really benefit the citizens an projects which improve education healthcare and infrastructure
of course the ` european parliament ] ` domand ] that the commission is fully transparent in all negotiations and that we are provided with timely sectoral impact assessment
i believe that this opportunity should be used by ` parliament ] to strongly support an eft with % jpan ] for the following reasons the % european union ] ind % japan ] are industrial giants that shared democratic values and together represent
the economic benefits are clear
we share similar challenges the rise of % china ] the global financial crisis decreasing * h ] demographics the need to access rol materials and energy sources and to achieve price stability
in addition we will support bilateral safeged measures as was the case with the * south carrer ft ] to avoid % syria ]'s injury to the sensitive sectores such as multimotive lectronic aviation and ` maciniry ]
therefore i seit great potential in further developing trade relations with % japan ] our! six ] largest trading partner
i would like to retivate th nontarif barriers and public procurement are crucial areers for ) european ] businesses where % japan ] needs to make significant concessions
however unfortunately the practice shows that there are always companies operating within the % eu ] that will try to circomvent the rules to gain questtionable advantages
they create many jobs in * europe ] and make important investments that is true
@ more than year ]
much of the credit for that gos to the rapporteur and the ` eca ] will support this report in ` clenary ]
ot just ` motherhood ] and ` apple py ] to use the ) american ] expression but it is of some real value
there already countries in the process whose political systems give lessthan full throwt od support to the democratic freedoms and plorarity needed for effective university sector and the admission of belarouse would give even more cause for concern over the confidence we want to have in the process
the legacy is repression isolation and corruption and there is a expectation about the new transition government although its tered by a formor vice president of } bugave ] himself } misan angaa ]
it is probably it is probably n a good thing that precisely at this time when we are reconsidering our strategic partnership with * africa ] we should get the chance to prove what we can actually mean in re constituting a democratic state in the southern part of * th african continent ] and in helping it along both democraticly and and and economicly
% zimbabwe ] has tremendous possibilities that it could use in its relationship with * europe ]
is there any other strategy
this is a desaster
s to be soved some how
it is not the responsibility of my country hungery
we are not the ones we are going to sove it we are going to continue protecting our country and protecting the * shangen ] borders of * europe ] in accordance with our obligations
~ first ] i would like to commend your efforts to increase the overol a road safety by the initiative to include new advioance safety features into cas and troks
~ thirdly ] and finally i do regret that your proposal for a regulational electronic & freaght ] transport information did not come alittle bit earlier in the ~ first ] mobility package because it could have served as a solid legal base for the enforsement part of the & lexpetsialis ] on posting o for the & cabatarge directive ]
we must make sure that they are going to be accessible to every future car owner because safety must not become a privileage of luxury our owners
buti would like to ask your ` ggo ] what do you think will happen if countries like } sweeden den mark polan ] will be outside the ` banking union ]
mr president on behalf of my group i want to request that this package of reports be struck from the agenda of this sassion
i thinkmr president that this house should show some measure of humility and some respect for the democratic process
we all know that % ireland ] has rejected the & lisbon treaty ] and so it is of some wonderment to me that this house pursists in debating that matter
it is not democratically appropriate that this house would setaside the verduct of % ireland ] or that this house would be used to rac it up pressure on % ireland ] in @ the coming months ] to adopt a treaty that is clearly not in our interests or in the interests of the ) european ] people
very often in economic economically difficult times young people unfortunately get into drug abuse
is it possible that the european social fund could be used in a targeted way to try and help young people considering the problems that this causes not only to themselvesas individuals but to their families and to their communities which we can have a very severe effect on communities
% eu ] is built on the nations that we are stronger together and that fundamental rights and values must never be an issue up for & cm ] compromise
however i am worried about the current evelopement at the same time we see attacks on independent media on adibutig to people weh see attacks on women with see attacks on migrant
i welcome of course the new rule of ` larpot ] presented @ last week ] but we need to gor further
t solutions suggest important measurable goals involvement of civil society and a broader scope to & lso ] include fundamental rights and democracy we must make sure that % eu ] does not remain a ess tigar because this report is good but we need to make sure to provide it with t
soone of the best way of providing the tigle with teeth is through a stronger conditionality link to the budget
